I've found a authorization issue in coinbase! :-)\n\nIssue\n=======\nWhen we login to coinbase using PC (not authorized) it asks for authorization using a link, which is sent to our email and we have to authorize it by clicking on that email; but, when we login to a windows phone (using a browser), it doesn't requires any authorization, and we directly login, it shows the transactions and the total balance in our wallet, which is no doubt **Information Disclosure**; further, if we go to this URL https://www.coinbase.com/settings, we can edit our settings [change password, delete account, change other settings] etc.. so this is no doubt **Authorization/Authentication** Issue.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Login with Windows Phone (Lumia). \n2. It won't ask for any authorization, and it will disclose the transactions etc..\n3. Go to https://www.coinbase.com/settings.\n4. Now you can also *edit* the settings.\n\nHow to Fix?\n----------------\nWhen we login to windows phone using browser, it *should* ask for authorization!
