What I would like to say is, I can’t proof yet the issue with my own account, but I can proof the issue at other people account since their invoice is catchup already by Google Bot.\n.\nI. Introduction\n===\nTo make people easily processing and also generating the invoices, HarvestApp providing various way such as web invoices access, .pdf creation, and also send it directly to the customer that work together with them.\n\nIn general, for accessing the Web Invoices, HarvestApp generating some __unique thing__ (well, let’s called it as a __hash__) so no one can be access into those web invoices directly without knowing those uniques hash.\n\u003eFor example, I have an invoices with unique ID = __#10188365__ and I would like to send it to customer or someone that I trust so they can see it earlier before sending it to customer.\n\n\u003eIn this situation, we just need to click the __“Web Invoices”__ feature and HarvestApp will automatically generate the unique hash just like = `https://justforpoc.harvestapp.com/client/invoices/2cbcd8b629d2250b7e4e082ec263be7c01299e34`.
