The `www.hackerone.com` being hosted on a third party, this can lead to private url information being passed to third party.    \n\n**Description**\n\nA `referrer policy` header is set on all pages including **/hacktivity** to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` wherein the full path of the url will be set as the `referer` only if the request is `same-origin`. But it was seen that although this header being set at /hacktivity page, it still sends a full url to an different origin ie `www.hackerone.com`. www.hackerone.com being hosted on a third party and also even after setting the referrer-policy header the hacktivity page sends full url in the referer header. This is something serious here. \n\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n+ Sign-in to hackerone.\n+ Start a web debugging proxy like burp to capture the request.\n+ Click on hacktivity tab -  https://hackerone.com/hacktivity. The url will contain filter parameters that are set default eg `https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular\u0026filter=type%3Aall\u0026page=1\u0026range=forever`. This is the `popular` hackivity page with default filters. capture the request and response. The response looks like this.\n\n\n```:status:                           200\ndate:                              Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:42:21 GMT\ncontent-type:                      text/html; charset=utf-8\ncache-control:                     private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\ncontent-disposition:               inline; filename=\"response.html\"\nx-request-id:                      d7905553-8780-4731-93b8-021b4761817a\nset-cookie:                        __Host-session=\u003cRedacted value\u003e; path=/; secure; HttpOnly\nstrict-transport-security:         max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload\nexpect-ct:                         enforce, max-age=86400\ncontent-security-policy:           \u003cRedacted as long for clarity\u003e\nreferrer-policy:                   strict-origin-when-cross-origin\nx-content-type-options:            nosniff\nx-download-options:                noopen\nx-frame-options:                   DENY\nx-permitted-cross-domain-policies: none\nx-xss-protection:                  1; mode=block\nserver:                            cloudflare-nginx\ncf-ray:                            3cbe5c199a952db5-BOM\ncontent-encoding:                  gzip```\n\n**Note** - If we look at the `referrer-policy:` header it is set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.\n\n+ Click on `blog` link at the bottom of the page and capture the request. The request looks like this. \n\n```:method:         GET\n:path:           /blog\n:authority:      www.hackerone.com\n:scheme:         https\nuser-agent:      Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0\naccept:          text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\naccept-language: en-US,en;q=0.5\naccept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nreferer:         https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular\u0026filter=type%3Aall\u0026page=1\u0026range=forever\ncookie:          \u003cRedacted cookie values\u003e\nif-none-match:   \"1513035467\"```\n\n**Note** - The `referer:` header contains the full url path inspite of referrer-policy header being set to strict-origin-when-cross-origin. This is a security violation as www.hackerone.com is not a `same-origin` and also hosted on a third party.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe hackivity url does not contain any private or hidden paths. But even after a strict header being set, this behaviour is a threat as it violates the policy. If a header is set, the policy must be followed and enforced. This is to be ensured for better security.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was found that although the \u003ccode\u003ereferrer-policy\u003c/code\u003e header for \u003ca title=\"https://hackerone.com/hacktivity\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/hacktivity\"\u003ehttps://hackerone.com/hacktivity\u003c/a\u003e was set to \u003ccode\u003estrict-origin-when-cross-origin\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/code\u003e, a request to \u003ca title=\"https://www.hackerone.com/blog\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackerone.com%2Fblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://www.hackerone.com/blog\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e contains full url path of the the hackivity page as the \u003ccode\u003ereferer\u003c/code\u003e header eg. \u003ccode\u003ehttps://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular\u0026amp;filter=type%3Aall\u0026amp;page=1\u0026amp;range=forever\u003c/code\u003e.
