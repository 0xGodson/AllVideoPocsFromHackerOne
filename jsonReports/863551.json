Hacker.one was no where in scope back then if seen with fact but it was still treated nicely? do we or hackerone customers go to hacker.one to submit vulnerabilities or view reports? i don't go there. I go to hackerone.com but why? due to the trust, and if attacker has defaced hackerone.com subdomain, victim would surely go there due to hackerone.com subdomain and trust! It can be used for phishing, data entry, surveys, xss and many more things I believe defacing means that right? you chose `High` option in severity for `Privilege Escalation` i mentioned before it should be `low` if not `none` because uberflip is a public product, but you chose it `high` so this vulnerability doesn't go above `low` severity because changing it to `low` would make this vulnerability `medium` severe. I am quite surprised I have to explain the impact of that vulnerability which is quite straight forward and not complex. The main thing is a domain, which is hackerone.com domain, which people trusts and due to hackerone.com subdomain we could have done much more actions. People wont trust a phishing page with pleaselogin.tk domain but would trust resources.hackerone.com.\n\nAt first you said it would serve as www.hackerone.com only after taking over subdomain that's why it is being treated low, I shown the way of defacing it, then still its a low severe vulnerability. Totally fine. As i couldn't takeover myself and see what could happen. Here are some points i am mentioning below what could be achieved after defacing and how it'd hurt confidentially.\n\nI have a recommendation, why don't you put any type of survey in resources.hackerone.com and mention that winner would get $500 as a reward, and once done just tell me, I'd send that link to victims and let's see if they'd respond or not, I think that'd affect confidentiality of hackerone customers and researchers, and also think that if that survey was served in other domain which is not known and random to people,  would people still fill that survey for that website then? and now you'd say this is social engineering i believe, well what are subdomain takeovers then?  I am hoping that i'd just get more questions so the severity don't get increased, This was a `high` severity issue if was treated fairly, but unfortunately, it was never. I can't argue more, you can disclose the report after review and don't forget to remove the attachments I mentioned previously before disclosure if possible, thanks.","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/jobert\"\u003e@jobert\u003c/a\u003e Okay sir, how this \u003ca href=\"/reports/202767\"\u003e#202767\u003c/a\u003e affected confidentially directly? whereas it was info.hacker.one and mine is hackerone.com subdomain, it was rewarded with $1000 independently twice for two takeovers saying that \u0026quot;\u003ccode\u003eWhile this is a vulnerability in a third-party service (Unbounce), we had started using for a few marketing landing pages as a test, so we greatly appreciate the report to make sure that any services and systems we use are protected.\u003c/code\u003e\u0026quot; and not even a hackerone.com subdomain, it is 3 years old report whereas now companies are more concerned about security and rewards etc everything improved as of now than 3 years before, i have a question why did you treated that report well when it was a hacker.one subdomain and reporter didn\u0026#39;t even show impact anywhere and now i have to? Hacker.one was no where in scope back then if seen with fact but it was still treated nicely? do we or hackerone customers go to hacker.one to submit vulnerabilities or view reports? i don\u0026#39;t go there. I go to hackerone.com but why? due to the trust, and if attacker has defaced hackerone.com subdomain, victim would surely go there due to hackerone.com subdomain and trust! It can be used for phishing, data entry, surveys, xss and many more things I believe defacing means that right? you chose \u003ccode\u003eHigh\u003c/code\u003e option in severity for \u003ccode\u003ePrivilege Escalation\u003c/code\u003e i mentioned before it should be \u003ccode\u003elow\u003c/code\u003e if not \u003ccode\u003enone\u003c/code\u003e because uberflip is a public product, but you chose it \u003ccode\u003ehigh\u003c/code\u003e so this vulnerability doesn\u0026#39;t go above \u003ccode\u003elow\u003c/code\u003e severity because changing it to \u003ccode\u003elow\u003c/code\u003e would make this vulnerability \u003ccode\u003emedium\u003c/code\u003e severe. I am quite surprised I have to explain the impact of that vulnerability which is quite straight forward and not complex. The main thing is a domain, which is hackerone.com domain, which people trusts and due to hackerone.com subdomain we could have done much more actions. People wont trust a phishing page with pleaselogin.tk domain but would trust resources.hackerone.com.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt first you said it would serve as \u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackerone.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ewww.hackerone.com\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e only after taking over subdomain that\u0026#39;s why it is being treated low, I shown the way of defacing it, then still its a low severe vulnerability. Totally fine. As i couldn\u0026#39;t takeover myself and see what could happen. Here are some points i am mentioning below what could be achieved after defacing and how it\u0026#39;d hurt confidentially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have a recommendation, why don\u0026#39;t you put any type of survey in resources.hackerone.com and mention that winner would get $500 as a reward, and once done just tell me, I\u0026#39;d send that link to victims and let\u0026#39;s see if they\u0026#39;d respond or not, I think that\u0026#39;d affect confidentiality of hackerone customers and researchers, and also think that if that survey was served in other domain which is not known and random to people,  would people still fill that survey for that website then? and now you\u0026#39;d say this is social engineering i believe, well what are subdomain takeovers then?  I am hoping that i\u0026#39;d just get more questions so the severity don\u0026#39;t get increased, This was a \u003ccode\u003ehigh\u003c/code\u003e severity issue if was treated fairly, but unfortunately, it was never.
