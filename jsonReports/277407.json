Users have been provided with an option to invite friends as referrals. It is possible to abuse your email invite service by repeating the same request. It is a discredit to unikrn if someone repeatedly sends the referral mail to same account. A simple php script will do that work and also loss of server resources. \n\n2. It is possible to invite myself from my referral link and even verify account and get coins.\nUsing same emails to produce multiple accounts on Unikrn:\n\n3. The above flaw is more serious than self referring.\n  I can get verified account by using someone else's alias email (krishn.akrish759213@gmail.com ) which Unikrn thinks is unregistered. The user with email(krishna.krish759213@gmail.com ) gets a verification link. He thinks it is a normal verification of his own account and verifies by clicking on it.\n\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n  1. Create an account with own email say \"Krishna.krish759213@gmail.com\"\n  2. Verify it! Get your referral link.\n  3. Clear cookies and create a new account with email like \"krishn.akrish759213@gmail.com\"\n  4. Even though unikrn considers it as a new email, it is same in terms of gmail.\n  5. Therefore same account get a mail saying to verify.  Just verify it.\n\nKrishna.krish759213@gmail.com and krishnak.rish759213@gmail.com are same and it is possible to fake as many times as all possible permutation of dot in the email.\n\nIt is possible to write automate the entire process of referral abuse using single email with a simple php CURL script.\n\n","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e Abuse of Email Invite and Referral Abuse\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDescription:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogic Flaws :\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsers have been provided with an option to invite friends as referrals.
