The issue is visible in the last 30 seconds.\n\nYou will see I look up ID of the generated file in the database to speed up the demonstration. We could scan through pages automatically with a script to make this bug more viable.\n\nReproduction steps:\n- Open two different browsers (to simulate two different users)\n- BROWSER 1: Log in as a user\n- BROWSER B: Log in as another user\n- BROWSER 1: Go to differential and create a new diff. Make it visible to just yourself\n- BROWSER 1: Update the diff a few times (I've seen the bug more reproducible when the diff is long and the update weaves in changes throughout the file, though this may not actually be a factor)\n- BROWSER B: Visit the diff page, see it is restricted and you cannot see it.\n- BROWSER 1: On the diff page, click \"View Options\" \u003e \"Show Raw File (Right)\". This generates a File.\n- BROWSER B: Start guessing file number pages (this could be done automatically).\n- BROWSER B: Eventually you will hit the file number of the new file and can see the private diff from BROWSER 1.\n\nExpected result:\n- The file generated by Phabricator while comparing diffs should not be accessible.
