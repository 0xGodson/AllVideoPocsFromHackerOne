This one is the information for the deap library.\n\n**Module:**\n\n[deap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deap)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nUtilities function in all the listed modules can be tricked into modify the prototype of \"Object\" when the attacker control part of the structure passed to these function. This can let an attacker add or modify existing property that will exist on all object.\n\n**Description:** \n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\nThe simplest test case to reproduce the issue is the following code snippet. In the code snippet, \"malicious_payload\" would come from an endpoint which accepts JSON data. The test case also works with the \"deap.extend\" function, the \"deap\" function and the \"deap.clone\" function.\n\n\u003e var deap= require('deap');\n\u003e var malicious_payload = '{\"\\_\\_proto\\_\\_\":{\"oops\":\"It works !\"}}';\n\u003e \n\u003e var a = {};\n\u003e console.log(\"Before : \" + a.oops);\n\u003e deap.merge({}, JSON.parse(malicious_payload));\n\u003e console.log(\"After : \" + a.oops);\n\nThis shows that an attacker can add attributes to all existing object on the server. Additional attribute can be used to change the execution code flow or cause error on every subsequent request by replacing \"toString\" or \"valueOf\".\n\n## Impact: \n\nThis vulnerability is garanteed to at least obtain denial of service as all the library allow the property \"toString\" and \"valueOf\" to be replaced by a \"String\". This breaks the express module and forces the server to either crash or return a 500 to every subsequent request.\n\nMore complex payload can be crafted to gain remote code execution (see PoC in #309391).\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\nIf extra information is needed don't hesitate to ask.\n\n## Impact\n\nVariable. Server crash or the server becoming unable to respond to all request is garanteed, but more significant impact like remote code execution can be achieved in some cases.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eAs discussed in \u003ca href=\"/reports/309391\"\u003e#309391\u003c/a\u003e, here\u0026#39;s the separate report for each of the library.
