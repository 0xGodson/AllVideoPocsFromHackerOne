So the XSS vulnerability I found in this UI automatically applies to all websites, it allows running code in the context of *any* domain.\n\n**Description**\nURL Advisor frame is located under https://www.google.com/\u003cINJECT_ID\u003e/ua/url_advisor_balloon.html and https://www.yahoocom/\u003cINJECT_ID\u003e/ua/url_advisor_balloon.html in Microsoft Edge (always the same INJECT_ID value). It gets its content from a message sent via `window.postMessage()` without validating message origin. Under some circumstances it will assign that data as link target, so a malicious website can make that link point to a javascript: URL. Clickjacking then allows making the user click that link - while sites like google.com use X-Frame-Options header to disallow framing, no such restrictions are in place for the url_advisor_balloon.html frame.\n\n**Environment**\n- Scope: Application\n- Product name: Kaspersky Internet Security\n- Product version: 19.0.0.1088\n- OS name and version (incl SP): Windows 10.0.17134\n- Attack type: Universal XSS\n- Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n1. Download attached `server.py` and `universal_xss.html` to some directory on your computer and run `server.py` (Python 3 required). This is a very rudimentary HTTP server running on http://localhost:5000/, you could use some other web server as well.\n2. Edit the file %WINDIR%\\sysnative\\drivers\\etc\\hosts as administrator and add the following line: `127.0.0.1 www.google.example.com`. Normally, you would just use a subdomain of a domain you own - the host name has to start with \"www.google.\" for URL Advisor to apply to it.\n3. Open Microsoft Edge and go to http://www.google.example.com:5000/universal_xss.html\n4. As advised by the page, move your mouse and click somewhere on the page.\n\nYou will see an alert message saying: \"Hi, this is JavaScript code running on www.google.com.\" That's the result of the code `alert('Hi, this JavaScript code is running on ' + document.domain)` executing in the context of the Google website. Injecting code into any other domain would have been easily possible as well.\n\n**Recommendation**\nThis user interface should never be served as first-party, even once the vulnerability here is fixed. Any XSS vulnerability in Kaspersky code automatically elevates to Universal XSS otherwise, this is too dangerous. Frankly, I don't see why it is done in this way with Microsoft Edge - in Firefox and Internet Explorer the same UI is always served via kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com, so vulnerabilities here don't affect other websites.\n\n## Impact\n\nA malicious website can easily make users click by pretending to be a game. And while the user clicks, they will be allowing the attackers to inject code into various internet domains and exfiltrating data in the background.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn Microsoft Edge, URL Advisor UI is served as first-party content on every domain.
