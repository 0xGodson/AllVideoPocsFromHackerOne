click on xyz.com the domain remains same i.e xyz.com but site which is rendered is of starbucks.com.So the impact is that people will think xyz.com is a subdomain of starbucks.If the domain name is dirty then people will think starbucks is supporting such activities to grab attention of people.A new way of marketing strategy, ultimtely spoiling reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePFA screenshot there the site name is hackingig.com but site rendered is of starbucks.com\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope this was your doubt which i tried to explain in simple way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf
