Let us dive into it.\n\nWhen we login to zomato.com and click on `Order Food`, We are redirected to the endpoint like `/mumbai/order-food-online?delivery_subzone=10159` where `mumbai` is the city and `10159` is the `delivery_subzone`. \n\nThe important thing here is that the page contains our full address we selected for purchase. \n\n{F451667}\n\nAs we can see, the page displays our **full address** we selected. In our case, I have selected an address with Tag `Other`. This could also be our `Home` address in case of genuine regular users. \n\nOn digging deeper this value comes from the cookie `selectedAddressId`, which is set when a user selects a saved address. \n\nWhen a request is sent, the server looks for this value to display the address on the order page. \n\n\nBut there is a catch to it. The server only returns the **Full Address** if it matches the correct **delivery_subzone**. \nIf the value of selectedAddressId does not match the delivery_subzone in which the address id falls under, the server only returns the **geo-location** and not the full address. \n\nLet us see this in practice:\n\n**Request**\n\n```\n:method: GET\n:path: /mumbai/order-food-online?delivery_subzone=10159\n:authority: www.zomato.com\n:scheme: https\nuser-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0\naccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\naccept-language: en-US,en;q=0.5\naccept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nreferer: https://www.zomato.com\ncookie: selectedAddressId=████████\n```\n\nNow in above request We have requested the server to fetch the Full Address of `AddressId=██████`. (This is my genuine AddressId) with the subzone 10159 (genuine subzone).\n\nThis is how a normal request looks like. The response will contain by **Full Address** because my subzone value is right. \n\nNow this can be used to enumerate the addresses of users **provided you have the right subzone value**\n\n###Why is this attack Practical and Impactful\n\n1. This can fetch the full address of any AddressId provided you have the right delivery_subzone value.\n2. If an attacker has the right subzone value he can get the full address associated with the AddressId. \n3. This attack also works in an **unauthenticated manner**. meaning the attacker needs to just set the target AddressId in the cookie field without authenticating, which makes tracing difficult. (cookie: selectedAddressId=████)\n4. **Lastly and Most Important** - There is **no Rate limiting**\n\nThe combination of an unauthenticated attacker with no rate limiting makes this attack seamlessly practical. I have tried couple of random values myself and managed to verify and obtain the full address of the victim.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\nHere for the sake of reproducability, you can use my genuine address Id - `███`. This has value `██████` (My genuine Address :) )\n\n1. Login to zomato\n2. Click on `Order Food`\n3. Intercept the request and send to repeater (Burp Suite)\n4. Now change `selectedAddressId` cookie to `cookie: selectedAddressId=████`\n5. You will receive mu full address in the response.\n\nYou can also use my alternate test account AddressId `███` and the delivery_subzone `1050`\nThe expected value is `Other - A wing, imaginary road, Dahisar West`. \n\n###Exploit Raw Request\n\n```\n:method: GET\n:path: /mumbai/order-food-online?delivery_subzone=10159\n:authority: www.zomato.com\n:scheme: https\nuser-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0\naccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\naccept-language: en-US,en;q=0.5\naccept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nreferer: https://www.zomato.com\ncookie: selectedAddressId=████████\n```\n\n###Exploit CURL request\n\n`curl \"https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/order-food-online?delivery_subzone=1050\" -H \"Host: www.zomato.com\" -H \"User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0\" -H \"Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\" -H \"Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\" --compressed -H \"Referer: https://www.zomato.com\" -H \"Cookie: selectedAddressId=██████;\" -H \"Connection: keep-alive\"`\n\n## Impact\n\n1.
