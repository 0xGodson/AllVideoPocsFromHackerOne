attacker can use Logout CSRF + Login CSRF against a victim to steal all information sent by the victim to the HackerOne website while using the malicious session, including confidential bug reports.\n\n2) Open Redirect\n\nSince the SSO-SAML l​ogin flow can be started automatically (`GET https://hackerone.com/users/saml/sign_in?email=███`) by an attacker and it redirects to external URLs, the attacker can redirect the user to anywhere.\n\n3) Self-XSS Possible Exploitation​\n\nSome stored Self-XSS's (internal areas accessed just by the victim, etc.) can be exploited through Login CSRF.\n\n```\nMalicious page -\u003e HackerOne Login CSRF -\u003e Self-XSS triggers -\u003e Logout -\u003e Wait user actions\n```\n\nIf the user interacts with the page (sign in with his account, etc.), the attacker can exploit the Self-XSS.\n\nP.S.:\n\nAn attacker can add extra dots to the SAML Email Domain in the config dialog.\nI didn't test all the implications, but registering a very similar domain could be a bad thing, like `hackerone..com`, `hackerone.com.`, `.hackerone.com` or even `gmail..com` because of typing mistakes (`victim@hackerone..com would redirect the victim to the
