Add a new staff member and give him access to `settings`. \n2. Login with the Staff member account and go to `https://\u003cyour_store\u003e.myshopify.com/admin/fulfillment_services/signup_for_mws` , you'll be redirected to a link in amazon.com that looks like this :\n\n```\nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/mws/registration/register.html/188-6388224-3450104?ie=UTF8\u0026AWSAccessKeyId=\u003cKEY\u003e\u0026Signature=\u003cSginature\u003e\u0026SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256\u0026SignatureVersion=2\u0026id=\u003cid\u003e\u0026returnPathAndParameters=%3Fshop_id%3D000000\u0026signInPageDisplayed=1\n```\n3.- Save this link then logout and login with the owner account after that delete the staff member account you have added. \n5.- Open a new browser , go to the link you have saved , login with your amazon account , authorize shopify and the account will be added to the store.\n6.- login to the store admin then go to `https://\u003cyour_store\u003e.myshopify.com/admin/settings/shipping/fulfillment_dropshipping` and you'll see that the account was added.\n7 -
