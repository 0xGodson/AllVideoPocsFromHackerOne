Login to your unverified Stripo account, and then intercept the request made while clicking on the \"Resend it\" text at the top-right corner of the webpage. The HTTP Request would look like this:\nRequest URL: https://my.stripo.email/cabinet/stripeapi/v1/resendEmailConfirmation\nRequest Method: POST\nRequest Data: {}\nStep 2. With the obtained information, create a HTML code like this:\n```\n\u003cbody onload=\"document.form.submit()\"\u003e\n\u003cform name=\"form\" method=\"POST\" action=\"https://my.stripo.email/cabinet/stripeapi/v1/resendEmailConfirmation\"\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n```\nStep 3.

If the Same-origin Policy hadn't existed, an attacker would have been able to, for example, put any image as someone's profile photo or delete anyone's profile photo, but this doesn't exist, all thanks to the SOP and the content-type \"application/json\" necessity.\n\nAnother way to fix the vulnerability is to introduce the CSRF token system, if you are thinking about bringing a change to the Stripo platform.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n  * An image has been attached along with this vulnerability report.\n\n## Impact\n\nAs a result of this vulnerability, an attacker would be able to lead the victim in receiving confirmation email without even knowing and without clicking any buttons or filling up any details.\n\nI would be looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nThanks,\n@binit","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s no CSRF protection in confirmation email resending feature as a result of which an attacker can trick the victim to receive a confirmation email unknowingly.
