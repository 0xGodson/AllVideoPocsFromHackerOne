I have noticed that this is not CSRF protected, but this was a minor issue. Well, it became a serious problem after I noticed that after adding that gift card in my card, I wasn't able to fully empty my cart anymore and the credit card option was simply not available anymore and I wasn't able to fulfill any orders. Logging out and in doesn't do anything. Deleting cart product doesn't do anything. And because I tested teavana for some time, I know for a fact that the items in cart stay in cart (even after weeks).\n\nSo, I have made a new account, added the CSRF POC in a script then tested the flow and it worked. I have made my account unable to buy anything by adding that gift card in cart.\n\nIMPACT\n----------------\nPermanently denying a user the possibility to fulfill with his account any orders is a very big issue (hence the High severity I personally find) and if someone launched an attack against you, you will lose customers and money (not to mention the potentially negative publicity)\n\nVideo POC
