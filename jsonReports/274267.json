For example, if `target = \"example.com/badpath?query=\"`, then the result will be\n```\nhttps://example.com/badpath?query=/path\n```\nIf `target = \"example.com/badpath#fragment\"`, then the result will be\n```\nhttps://example.com/badpath#fragment/path\n```\nAdditionally, `target = \"example.com:9999\"` could change the port:\n```\nhttps://example.com:9999/path\n```\nor `target = \"user:pass@example.com\"` could change credentials:\n```\nhttps://user:pass@example.com/path\n```\n\nReturning a URI with an attacker-controlled path/query/fragment is potentially dangerous if used directly or if other URIs are created from it using string concatenation. For example, if `api_endpoint` returns `\"https://example.com/malicious.gz#\"`, and some other code tries to create a new URI by appending `\"/good.gz\"`, then the resulting URI will be `https://example.com/malicious.gz#/good.gz`, with the intended path being hidden in the fragment component of the URI. However, I did not find any places in the code where this happens; code that on first glance looks vulnerable:\n```\n    spec_path  = api_uri + \"#{file_name}.gz\"\n```\nis actually safe because the `+` is not string concatenation, but the `merge` method of `URI::Generic`. It is still possible to replace the user, password, and port, but those do not offer an obvious path to exploitation.\n\nProbably it's better not to parse `target` as a URI at all; rather to insist that it have the form of a hostname only.\n\nCommit [8d91516fb7037ecfb27622f605dc40245e0f8d32](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/8d91516fb7037ecfb27622f605dc40245e0f8d32) began parsing `target` as a URI in order to compare the host component as a fix for CVE-2017-0902; however it does not discard components other than the host when building the result.\n","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003ePasting the original commit message here for posterity (it had more details than the message I sent to the security@ list).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eapi_endpoint\u003c/code\u003e function inserts an untrusted string into the middle of a URI:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eURI.parse \u0026quot;#{uri.scheme}://#{target}#{uri.path}\u0026quot;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intention is that \u003ccode\u003etarget\u003c/code\u003e only replaces the host component of the URI; for example if \u003ccode\u003euri.scheme = \u0026quot;https\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003euri.path = \u0026quot;/path\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003etarget = \u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e, then the result will be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003ehttps://example.com/path\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut \u003ccode\u003etarget\u003c/code\u003e could contain other URI syntax that masks \u003ccode\u003euri.path\u003c/code\u003e.
