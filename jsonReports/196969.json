From the wording and instructions it is very likely that users will do the wrong thing: Paste the config.php without removing all passwords, for various reasons:\n\nIt's likely to assume that many users won't read the detailed instructions and will just do the first thing they're told: Insert the content of config/config.php.\nThe instruction with sudo and www-data is specific to certain server configurations and may not work everywhere, thus it will fail for some users who will try the next option, namely inserting config.php directly.\nThe instruction \"Without the database password, passwordsalt and secret\" is incomplete. There can be more sensitive fields in the config file, e.g. \"mail_smtppassword\".\nNot surprisingly users misread these instructions and paste sensitive passwords.
