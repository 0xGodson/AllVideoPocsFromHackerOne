You can't access it, but you can see it.\n\nFirst of all, what you've described is a security issue itself. why would i be able to **see** a semi-launched program? isn't it meant to be private?\ni didn't just \"stumbled upon\" on special program who announced they have a private program. \n**I extracted some information of that program, which should've kept private.**\nI can gather a list of private program just by Google dork (search with `inurl:security intext:hackerone intext:contact us`, you'll get atleast 7/8 companies who has private program on HackerOne) and there's some other effective ways.\nBut i can never **see** that program, unless I'm invited to that particular program.\n\n\u003eI agree the `confidential` label is a bit confusing and we're going to work on better wording.\n\nThis is not confusing at all. there's a bug behind this behavior, which causing this. what confusing is your response on this report and you need to work better on this.\n\nI'm able to harvest **program policy** of a private (you agreed it's a private program and i can see`soft_launched=true` which ensure it is indeed a private) program, where it describes all of its tiers (tears 1 to 5) and scopes and all. \nI'm able to extract `bug_count` of a private program, where it shows how many bugs got solved. in this case it was **5**\nI'm able to see the minimum bounty `base_bounty` of a private program. which is $100 in this case.\nAnd after all these confidential information disclosure you've changed status of this report to **Informative**?\n\nLets go to HackerOne's [program scope](https://hackerone.com/security) and see what it says, \n\u003e Reports which enumerate already claimed user and program handles. This reveals no sensitive information, regardless of whether the associated profiles are public or private.\n\nTrue that. only knowing private programs handle reveals no sensitive information. But revealing total bug count, program policy and minimum bounty surely does. these are sensitive information and they should be kept as confidential.\n\nNow lets take a look at this issue to some other kinda similar issues which are fixed and rewarded,\n\n#124611 - Disclosure of private programs that have an \"external\" page on HackerOne\nIssue: Know whether there's a private program exist or not through response.\nDisclosed sensitive information: NONE\n\n#118965 - Distinguish EP+Private vs Private programs in HackerOne\nIssue: Know whether there's a private program exist or not through response.\nDisclosed sensitive information: NONE\n\n#116798 - Private Program Disclosure in /:handle/settings/allow_report_submission.json endpoint\nIssue: Know whether there's a private program exist or not through response.\nDisclosed sensitive information: NONE\n\n#116032 - Private Program Disclosure in /:handle/reports/draft.json endpoint\nIssue: Know whether there's a private program exist or not through response.\nDisclosed sensitive information: NONE\n\n#105887 - Know whether private program for company exist or not\nIssue: Know whether there's a private program exist or not through response.\nDisclosed sensitive information: NONE\n\n#81083 - Internal bounty and swag details disclosed as part of JSON response\nIssue: this issue was leaking `base_bounty` just like mine.\nDisclosed sensitive information: `base_bounty`, `offers_swag`\n\n_This report_ #159526 - **Information leakage of a private program**\nIssue: leaking sensitive information of a private program.\nDisclosed sensitive information:    `\"bug_count\":5` `\"minimum_bounty\":100`  `\"soft_launched\":true` `\"policy\":\"briefed policy, see attached .txt file\"`\n\nIt's funny when all the mentioned reports were welcomed, promptly fixed and awarded with monetary rewards, but this report was closed as **informative** saying the behavior is **confusing** and instead of rolling a fix you guys gonna work on wording.","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHello \u003ca href=\"/wvdv\"\u003e@wvdv\u003c/a\u003e,\u003cbr\u003e\nThank your for your reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou stumbled upon a very special program, \u003ccode\u003e███\u003c/code\u003e announced publicly that they have a private program!
