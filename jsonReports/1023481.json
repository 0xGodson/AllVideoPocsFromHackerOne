Without a Strict Transport Security policy the web application may be vulnerable against several attacks:\n\n    If the web application mixes usage of HTTP and HTTPS, an attacker can manipulate pages in the unsecured area of the application or change redirection targets in a manner that the switch to the secured page is not performed or done in a manner, that the attacker remains between client and server.\n    If there is no HTTP server, an attacker in the same network could simulate a HTTP server and motivate the user to click on a prepared URL by a social engineering attack.\n\nThe protection is effective only for the given amount of time. Multiple occurrence of this header could cause undefined behaviour in browsers and should be avoided.\n\n## Impact\n\nA Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header should be sent with each HTTPS response. The syntax is as follows:\n\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=\u003cseconds\u003e[; includeSubDomains]\n\nThe parameter max-age gives the time frame for requirement of HTTPS in seconds and should be chosen quite high, e.g. several months. A value below 7776000 is considered as too low by this scanner check. The flag includeSubDomains defines that the policy applies also for sub domains of the sender of the response\n\nRegards\nwhitehat1443hacker","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eHello\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have found security vulnerable\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vulnerable URL: \u003ca title=\"https://bugpoc.com/icons/bandage.svg\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbugpoc.com%2Ficons%2Fbandage.svg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://bugpoc.com/icons/bandage.svg\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSummary\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe table below shows the numbers of issues identified in different categories.
