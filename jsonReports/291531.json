Since you request any query to it, it's pretty important that we have this adequately secured. \n\nWe don't agree with the security impact of your findings. Let me address them one by one/\n\nIntrospection is not something limited to internal use, quite the opposite; it's super useful for external implementers to know how your API/domain works. We even encourage you to use it to make recognizance less of a hassle. The idea is that it makes your hacker life easier and therefore our product more secure.\n\nWe're okay with exposing disabled users. For example, you still want to see the reporter's details of an old report filed by a user that's now blocked. To support this, we have to allow you to query blocked users.\n\nNext one, database id. We're, again, entirely okay exposing the database id.
