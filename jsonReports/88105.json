This allows to insert another attribute like `onmouseover` to execute Javascript code.\r\nTo exploit this bug, you need to retitle a video to something like `\"onmouseover=\"alert(document.domain)\u0026#x2f;` and put the title as the search query in the URL. The character `/` has to be encoded like `\u0026#x2f;` because if you send the character `/` as `%2F` you will get a 404 response.\r\n\r\n__Proof of concept__\r\n1. Upload a new video via https://vimeo.com/upload, or go to the Settings of one that you already uploaded.\r\n2. Enter `\"onmouseover=\"alert(document.domain)\u0026#x2f;` for the _Title_ of the video.\r\n3. Click on _Save Changes_.\r\n4.
