I'm going to explain it here:\nIn https://www.twitterflightschool.com/ domain if you try to reset your password from https://www.twitterflightschool.com/student/authentication/request_password_reset you'll get a reset password link in your email that is like:\n`https://www.twitterflightschool.com/student/authentication/reset_password/\u003cTOKEN\u003e`\n**If you logged in to your account**  your application doesn't validate token at all, Actually for reset password, we don't need a token! and just via `https://www.twitterflightschool.com/student/authentication/reset_password/` link, we can reset our password!\n\nIn this domain, On the profile page, for changing the password you should enter the current password first but using this issue it's possible to bypass this and update the password without knowing the current password.\n**Note:** For abusing this issue an attacker first need to hijack victim's session because while you using `https://www.twitterflightschool.com/student/authentication/reset_password/` to change password it changes current user password, So attack scenario is limited to when an attacker successfully hijacked a victim session and hi want to update password (but he don't know current password), Hi use this issue to bypass `Change Password` in profile section and update password without knowing the current password.\n\n## PoC\nWith the assumption that the victim's twitter session is 'hijacked' and in a 'logged in' state for the hacker.
