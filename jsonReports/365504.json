That means if you do not own the app on the account through which you are navigating to workshop item then you have on read access of the comment section tab but not write.\n\n\tHowever, this restriction can be bypassed using the IDOR vulnerability. Users are able to comment on the \"Artwork\" subsection for the same any app or game  and this subsection has no such restriction. select any artwork and while posting comment on the Artwork intercept the request using Burp or any proxy.\n\n\tOn intercepted request, change the contributor id of URL to workshop item contributor on which you want to post comment, change file id of URL to workshop item file id. There is post parameter on same request \"extended _data\" change the contributor id and app id that belong to the workshop item. Set the count parameter to number of comments currently on workshop item.\n\n\tNow forward the edited request and you would find that comment was successfully posted on the workshop item.\n\n\nProof of Concept:-\n\n\t I have reproduced this vulnerability using my profile named \"King Kong\" and has profile id 76561198039572190.
