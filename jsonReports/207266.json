The exploitation seems unlikely and purely theoretical but it might work in some cases. \n\n**Description (Include Impact):**\nTake downloading payments as CSV, for example, which is recently launched. The response to \nhttps://hackerone.com/settings/bounties.csv\nreturns CSV which is indeed, a comma separated values. There is a field which is influenced by user input i.e. report_title.\nAnd, as we all know, `script` inclusions are exempt from SOP. So, if the returned CSV forms valid JavaScript, it's possible that we can read information.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\nFor demonstration;\nI created an HTML page as follows;\n```html\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset='utf-8'/\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        var report_id,report_title,program_name,total_amount,amount,bonus_amount,currency,awarded_at,status;\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cscript src='https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties.csv'\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nAnd, edited returned response (using BurpSuite) as follows;\n```JavaScript\nreport_id,report_title,program_name,total_amount,amount,bonus_amount,currency,awarded_at,status\n████████\n████\n█████████\n████████\n██████\n████████\n```\n\nSo, what I did is added ```=` ```  right after first word of first report. Similarly added ``` `//``` right after last word of last report.\nThis makes it a valid JavaScript, and `XSS` a valid variable which now have all details in it. \n\n### Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)\nFirefox version 45.7.0\nUA:  Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0\nSafari may also work.\n","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe function \u0026quot;\u003cstrong\u003eDownload as CSV\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026quot; might leak information to 3rd domains.
