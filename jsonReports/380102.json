These protections are per-default enabled since approximately 10 years in Visual Studio and are very important because they make exploitation a lot harder (or even make some vulnerabilities not exploitable).\n\nPlease note: The Nextcloud code was updated on 4 September 2017 to enable ASLR and DEP. Here is the commit:\nhttps://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/commit/6f270a364895d7f1f0a424c8347cd2913971cca4#diff-95e351a3805a1dafa85bf20b81d086e6\n\nHowever, the current NextCloud Client (version 2.3.3.1) from 20 November 2017 from revision 57bc79 still doesn't have ASLR and DEP enabled.

For example, the current Nextcloud version uses QT 5.6.2 which was released on 11-Oct-2016.
