Although, it is possible to edit them by inspecting their user id from the `delete` button and then opening `https://stocky.shopifyapps.com/users/{user_id}/edit` endpoint. Furthermore, you can even make that user an admin by adding `user[admin]` to the request being sent once you save their profile. As the UI doesn't show an admin column for POS users, it becomes a bit transparent to any other admins that a POS User does have an actual account and what roles he's assigned to.\n\nThe thing is that to access the Stocky APP, it requires an actual staff member with the App permission so this is reducing the impact here. Still, that flaw could be abused by a Staff Member whom was granted once the **Administrator** role within the app and took the opportunity to create a backdoor admin user from an already existing POS user and/or creating one for himself if he also had access to the Point Of Sale app. He could then be using that backdoor account at some point later if he does lose  its `Administrator` role from the app (assuming he still has the App permission).\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. From the Point Of Sale mobile application, open the Stocky Application with a POS User. (This is to create a POS User into the Stocky App - not sure if there's any other way)\n2.

Set an email address field to an email that you own, so you can actually use it to set the account password. To make it real the attacker user could be creating one with the actual POS User Firstname/LastName so it looks more real.\n5.
