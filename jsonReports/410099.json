Login as victim and check your infos in the account details\n2. Open the CSRF malicious file {F346689}\n3. Recheck the infos: now the email is different (also the username) {F346690}\n\n(In the video the `@` char is replaced with `%40` (url encoded version of the `@` char), but is due to a problem in the CSRF value, simply replacing `%40` to `@` in the `email` parameter, the `@` char appears).\n\nFor account takeover now:\n1. Go in anonymous mode (now you're the attacker that hasn't access to the accounts)\n2. The victim has opened the CSRF file, so your email is setted in the victim's account\n3. Go on the login, and request the `Forgot password` option, inserting the email used for replace the one of the victim\n4. You obtain a link for reset the password (I've not done a video, but if you can't reproduce the steps I can do one for these steps also :))\n\n**Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions**\nUse captchas and CSRF-tokens for be sure that the victim is changing the datas knowing that.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe ██████████████████ShopCart has a POST CSRF issue also in the account details, that can lead to account takeover replacing the email of the victim with the email of the attacker, and requesting a new password using the `Forgot password` option.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHi DoD team,\u003cbr\u003e\nsimilarly to the previous CSRF that I\u0026#39;ve reported, I\u0026#39;ve found another CSRF in the same domain, but on the \u003ccode\u003eAccount details\u003c/code\u003e option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDescription:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe CSRF issue allows me to modify the datas of every victim that is targeted using the CSRF file, and leading to account takeover simply setting my email as email of the victim: logging out I can recover the password of the infected account using the attacker-email that has replaced the victim-email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLogin as victim and check your infos in the account details\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOpen the CSRF malicious file {F346689}\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecheck the infos: now the email is different (also the username) {F346690}\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(In the video the \u003ccode\u003e@\u003c/code\u003e char is replaced with \u003ccode\u003e%40\u003c/code\u003e (url encoded version of the \u003ccode\u003e@\u003c/code\u003e char), but is due to a problem in the CSRF value, simply replacing \u003ccode\u003e%40\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003e@\u003c/code\u003e in the \u003ccode\u003eemail\u003c/code\u003e parameter, the \u003ccode\u003e@\u003c/code\u003e char appears).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor account takeover now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGo in anonymous mode (now you\u0026#39;re the attacker that hasn\u0026#39;t access to the accounts)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe victim has opened the CSRF file, so your email is setted in the victim\u0026#39;s account\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGo on the login, and request the \u003ccode\u003eForgot password\u003c/code\u003e option, inserting the email used for replace the one of the victim\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou obtain a link for reset the password (I\u0026#39;ve not done a video, but if you can\u0026#39;t reproduce the steps I can do one for these steps also :))\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUse captchas and CSRF-tokens for be sure that the victim is changing the datas knowing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"impact\"\u003eImpact\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ██████████████████ShopCart has a POST CSRF issue also in the account details, that can lead to account takeover replacing the email of the victim with the email of the attacker, and requesting a new password using the \u003ccode\u003eForgot password\u003c/code\u003e option.\u003c/p\u003e\n","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":5,"voters":["mygf","sa1tama0","rdes","reppie","dan_pew03"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"can_edit_custom_fields_attributes":false,"activities":[{"id":3341631,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
