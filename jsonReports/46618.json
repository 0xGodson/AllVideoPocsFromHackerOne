However, I did notice that the rate limiting for adding a phone number has still not been implemented. I was able to send 16 invalid phone numbers and then the 17th one was a valid number registered on the Robocoin application. As a result, I was able to add that person to my wallet. All I required was a request where I went through a list of phone numbers in the `phone` parameter as shown below:\n\n```\nPOST /dashboard/account/\u003credacted\u003e/sharing/create HTTP/1.1\nHost: wallet.robocoin.com\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nReferer: https://wallet.robocoin.com/dashboard\nContent-Length: 112\nCookie: SESSION=\u003credacted\u003e\nConnection: keep-alive\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nphone=%2B1+\u003cphone_number\u003e\u0026countryCode=US\u0026bankAccountPermissionType=SIGNER\u0026_csrf=\u003credacted\u003e\n```\n\nSo, to summarize, even with all the above fixes, I can still add any random Robocoin user to my wallet and leverage the Robocoin platform to send them emails (makes this a mass spamming attack). When a phone number that is registered on the application gets a hit (like the 17th one in my case), the person associated with that number gets added to my wallet. The name of that person then appears in the wallet shared list. So, this itself is enumeration where any malicious attacker can potentially go through a bunch of phone numbers and try to share his wallet with them. When a number works and the name appears, the attacker will know the victim's number and name, essentially reproducing the information disclosure issue again. The only difference here is that `only` the attacker is able to enumerate users and not other users with whom the wallet is shared.\n\nI would recommend implementing rate limitation in the above request and that should take care of all the issues described in this report. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or concerns. \n\nCheers!\n/ab","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHey,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll the above 3 fixes look good.
