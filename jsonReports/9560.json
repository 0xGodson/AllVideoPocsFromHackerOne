Multiple instances of r[] in the same URL is also possible.\r\n\r\nThis could be exploited by someone who wants to access another URL, but anonymously (except for your logs of course), or to access pages \"in your name\", making you look bad.\r\n\r\nIt could also be exploited in another, more serious way. If you happen to have any internal web servers that are not visible to the internet (for example a bug tracker), they might be visible to the computer hosting cloudflare.com. Then this vuln could be used to fetch files from the internal servers (given that the attacker knows the URLs or brute forces them).\r\n\r\nA search on Google for this type of URL shows that many sites has the same problem.
