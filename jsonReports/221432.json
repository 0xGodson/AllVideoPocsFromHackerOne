I was able to create an `attack.com` namespace which translates to `https://attack.com/repo/`.\nThe app will then send a request including the anti-CSRF token to an attacker controlled domain. Which it definitely should not, ever (see point 2. below).\n\n# Impact\n\nA malicious web page and the coordinated server will be able to perform actions through the victim's browser in a second.\n\nIn addition, this opens up a new attack surface as the app will process untrusted replies as trusted content. There is high risk of injecting javascript somewhere, maybe here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/f78ecda55d5431f9a74ab2892b516ecb45f24d80/app/assets/javascripts/environments/components/environment_terminal_button.js#L33\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIssues of this kind should be fixed globally, since the code is recent and developers are likely to introduce more `document.location` dependencies regularly.\n\n1.
