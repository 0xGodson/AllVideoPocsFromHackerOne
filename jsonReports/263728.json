As I mentioned above, we use a formula and, in fact, you can try it yourself here: \u003ca title=\"https://npm.runkit.com/password-complexify\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpm.runkit.com%2Fpassword-complexify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://npm.runkit.com/password-complexify\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003econst passwordComplexify = require(\u0026quot;password-complexify\u0026quot;)\nconsole.log(`Complexity for password \u0026#39;12345678\u0026#39;: ${passwordComplexify(\u0026#39;12345678\u0026#39;)}`);\nconsole.log(`Complexity for password \u0026#39;Test@1234\u0026#39;: ${passwordComplexify(\u0026#39;Test@1234\u0026#39;)}`);\nconsole.log(`Complexity for password \u0026#39;kHbji76gM(\u0026#39;: ${passwordComplexify(\u0026#39;kHbji76gM\\(\u0026#39;)}`);\nconsole.log(`Complexity for password \u0026#39;abcdefghijklmno\u0026#39;: ${passwordComplexify(\u0026#39;abcdefghijklmno\u0026#39;)}`);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026#39;re more than welcome to look at our client-side code, which is validating with a minimum score of 42, as well as password length between 8 and 32. For reference, a score of 42 is roughly 10 chars with Upper, Lower, Number, and Punctuation, but you could get a higher complexity score on an 8 character password by using other charsets, or get a higher score with a long string of numbers or a simple alphabet sequence, as you showed above. The string \u003ccode\u003eabcdefghijklmno\u003c/code\u003e gets a complexity score of 48.9.\u003c/p\u003e\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-30T16:16:22.081Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T16:18:28.093Z","actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1966569,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Requesting full disclosure","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eRequesting full disclosure\u003c/p\u003e\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-30T16:16:39.198Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T16:16:39.198Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2010753,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ManuallyDisclosed","message":"Disclosing since we're now getting duplicates of this report.","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eDisclosing since we\u0026#39;re now getting duplicates of this report.\u003c/p\u003e\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-09-21T07:32:26.152Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T07:32:26.152Z","actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/eb31823a4cc9f6b6bb4db930ffdf512533928a68a4255fb50a83180281a60da5"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
