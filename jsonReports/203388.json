But the problem here is the condition check before reading the file to the variable:\n\nFile: https://github.com/gratipay/gip.rocks/blob/master/www/v1.spt\n\n```python\nif int(request.headers['Content-Length']) \u003e 256 * 1024:\n    raise Response(413)\n\nimage_type = request.headers['Content-Type']\nif image_type not in ('image/png', 'image/jpeg'):\n    raise Response(415)\n\n# Load the image.\nfp = StringIO(request.raw_body)\nfp.seek(0)\nimage = Image.open(fp)\n\n```\n\nHere you can see that you are calculating the length of the incoming file from the `content-length` HTTP header and if it is less than `256 * 1024`, you will accept the request. But this is not a correct way to check size of the incoming file.\n\n## POC:\n\n1) Initiate a system wide proxy with burp suite\n\n2) Try to send a curl request with a huge file and see the request in curl\n\n3) The content length will be obviously greater than the max value application accepts but modify the `content-length` header to a value which is less than `256 * 1024`.\n\n4) Forward the request and you can see that the server will read the files to a variable and if the file is large enough, this is more than enough to DOS the server.\n\nNow since this deals with DOS, I haven't actually tried out this attack but we can easily confirm this from the source code that this can be bypassed in the way I explained above. I also tried deploying locally but I had a hard time making the software run locally and I don't have enough free time to debug what is happening.\n\nBut I think the bug is very clear from the source code itself, which is why I really didn't test it but thought to report it.\n\n## Mitigation:\n\nPutting your trust on HTTP headers may not be a good idea. But I am not really sure what is a solid method to find the proper length of the string in this case.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eHello team,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince you mentioned in the rules that all libraries listed on your github repositories are in scope, I decided to take a look at \u003ca title=\"http://gip.rocks\" href=\"/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgip.rocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttp://gip.rocks\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"problem\"\u003eProblem:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe application reads an image file and convert it into smaller formats, zip it and let the users to download the updated file.
