I have uploaded a video PoC to demo my finding. Note that the following test accounts were used:\n\n###Attacker\nlogin: ████████\n\n###Victim\nlogin: ███████\n\nI added `████` email into the victim account. Note that this only works on victims that have no recovery email address defined or recovery email that are not yet verified. This technique will NOT work on victims' that already have a confirmed recovery email address.\n\nAlso note, that I am using multi-containers plugin for Firefox, therefore, each tab represents separate browser session. Finally, note that in my PoC video, I had to insert the victim recovery email link `████████/self?guid=█████████` into the attackers' session because a valid session is required to validate the email.
