May 4th, 2016, [apok](https://hackerone.com/apok) reported a Denial of Service condition on our [user account statistics endpoint](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/stats/), which returns information about a user's map views over a specified period of time.\n\nAn attacker could trigger a potential denial of service condition by changing the value of the `interval` query string parameter from `day` to `hour` then requesting a time period of several years. We decided to first remove the `hour` interval option to resolve this issue. After [apok](https://hackerone.com/apok) reported a DoS condition when requesting an early start period of May 1997 with `interval=day`, we then implemented a limit of one year for all requests to the statistics endpoint.\n\nOn May 26th, 2016 we closed this report after deploying the fix to our production servers. \n\nNormally, Mapbox does not issue bounties on DoS related reports as we have rate limiting measures in place as well as automated monitoring alerts for potential DoS and brute force attacks. By contrast, this potential DoS condition would have been caused by a single request and would have evaded our rate limiting and monitoring measures.
