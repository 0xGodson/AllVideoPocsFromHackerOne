Create and fund account `H`, then set a trustline for ABC with limit 1\n3. Choose arbitrary price `P` higher than existing best ask price `Pa`\n4.

Account with a trustline for BUG asset (balance=500, limit=501) posted an offer to sell 100XLM to buy BUG at price 100 XLM per BUG. Result: account bought 1 BUG from the best ask at 9 XLM per BUG, and an offer to sell the remaining 91XLM at price 100 was saved into the orderbook.\n\nF268791: Real case on a public network on MOBI-XLM traiding pair happened to some user (this is where I noticed the anomaly in trade history and started investigation).

It could also confuse other market participants by creating the impression that P is the fair price for the asset.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003estellar-core improperly handles creation of a buy offer which crosses existing sell offers (immediate execution) but can only be filled partially due to a trustline limit on the source account.
