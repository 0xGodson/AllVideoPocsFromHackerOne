To quote from it:\n\n---\n\n## How Common are MITM Attacks?\nMy initial research into how common MITM attacks were actually stemmed from my research into maliciously compromising XML parsers that loaded DTD files loaded over HTTP in order to achieve XXE. More on this topic in a future writeup. What I found was quite alarming.\n\n### Internet Service Providers\nTo my surprise, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seem to be doing this quite regularly.\n\n\u003e Comcast began injecting 400+ lines of JavaScript code in to pages I requested on the internet so that when the browser renders the web page, the JavaScript generates a pop up trying to up-sell me a new modem.\n\u003e \\- [Comcast continues to inject its own code into websites you visit](https://thenextweb.com/insights/2017/12/11/comcast-continues-to-inject-its-own-code-into-websites-you-visit/)\n\nBharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) an ISP in India also has a history of injecting Ads into their user’s webpages when those pages are loaded over HTTP.\n\nThis indicates that the infrastructure already exists and could be re-targeted to impact JAR files.\n\n### Malicious Actors\n When malicious actors gain access to a system, they often quickly utilize their new foothold to establish a MITM. Every year, Verizon releases a Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) which analyzes the various attack vectors that were most commonly exploited each year. This is a quote from one of their reports.\n\n\u003e ## Actions\n\u003e The top three threat action categories were Hacking, Malware, and Social. The most common types of hacking actions used were the use of stolen login credentials, exploiting backdoors, and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\u003e \\- [Verizon 2011 Data Breach Investigations Report; Page 69](https://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigations-report-2011_en_xg.pdf)\n\nTo quote from the analysis from this report:\n\n\u003e I infer that it’s a secondary action used once somebody has a foothold in the system, but the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit’s data says it’s quite credible for concern. Of the 32 data breaches that made up their statistics, 15 involved MITM actions.\n\u003e \\- [Answer: Stack Exchange: Are “man in the middle” attacks extremely rare?\nMITM attacks should be considered a credible threat in software security.](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/12050)\n\n### Over a Public WiFi Connection\nSetting aside all of these other attack vectors, any developer working on any of these projects over a public WiFi connection has opened up their computer to the potential for malicious compromise. This attack was demonstrated with the famous Firefox plugin Firesheep.\n\n### Governments\nDue to the Snowden Revelations, we now understand the various methodologies used by the US Government’s three letter agencies to perform MITM attacks against US citizens.\n\n\u003e To trick targets into visiting a FoxAcid server, the NSA relies on its secret partnerships with US telecoms companies.
