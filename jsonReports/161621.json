@exception,\n\nThanks for this report. Indeed, it's one highly unusual place for one XSS, good catch!\nThe only way to exploit it I found would be to create a form like the following:\n\n```html\n\u003cform id=\"form\" method=\"____XSS___\" action=\"https://gratipay.com\"\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\ndocument.getElementById('form').submit();\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nHowever, none of my browsers allows this behaviour (it gets rewritten to GET). I'll try to see if some old browsers are less strict (aka don't follow the RFC) may permit it. This is the only condition to be able to exploit this.\n\nI was able [to reproduce your behaviour](https://gist.github.com/nashe/994bdb4150342e4f786033dbf1ff9238). It seems to come from Cowboy (see [their repository](https://github.com/heroku/cowboyku)), which is used in their routing stack. However, I can't find this error message in the source code, I need to continue digging to find the root cause.\n\nWhile trying to reproduce your problem, I also found the same behaviour in the web framework that Gratipay is using, [aspen](aspen.io) (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/nashe/21757cadcf78f8d4655a464d1a2197a8)). While it's not in our scope, it seems that they plan to [open a bug bounty](https://github.com/AspenWeb/salon/issues/3). \n\nI guess that @whit537 may be interested in this report, there is a lot to discuss.\n\nPlease be aware that we will need some time to handle your report, since we are a small team. We'll keep your informed of our progress (everything we say/do is public, we don't use team-only HackerOne messages).\n\nThanks for making Gratipay a safer place!","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHi \u003ca href=\"/exception\"\u003e@exception\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for this report.
