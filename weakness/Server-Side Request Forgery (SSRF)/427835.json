The requests can be directed to external websites as well as the internal network. \n\nAn attacker can use this vulnerability to exfiltrate data from the internal network that is not protected by other mechanisms, or to perform actions in the name of the server in the internal network which do not contain other protection mechanisms (reduced security is common in internal networks).\n\nAn attacker can also use this issue to scan the internal network as well as external websites for further vulnerabilities.\n\nA user account is required, but it does not require extended permissions.\n \nPOC\n---\n\n    GET /nextcloud/nextcloud/index.php/apps/calendar/v1/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fsecret HTTP/1.1\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    [...]\n    secret\n\nThe \"secret\" file is an example of a file located in the internal network that is not protected by further authentication.

If it is pointing to a private address, the request should not be performed. To reduce the impact of potential misuse of the host as a scanner, requests could be throttled.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of the issue could be reduced by processing the response server-side instead of client-side. Instead of displaying the entire HTTP response to the client, the response could be parsed and validated to ensure that it is in a calendar format. This way, non-calendar/ics information from internal networks would not leak to an attacker.\n\n## Impact\n\nexfiltrate data from the internal network and perform actions in the name of the server in the internal network","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"cvss\"\u003eCVSS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8.5 High \u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.first.org%2Fcvss%2Fcalculator%2F3.0%23CVSS%3A3.0%2FAV%3AN%2FAC%3AL%2FPR%3AL%2FUI%3AN%2FS%3AC%2FC%3AH%2FI%3AL%2FA%3AN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u0026quot;New Subscription\u0026quot; functionality of the official \u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnextcloud%2Fcalendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCalendar\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e app allows authenticated users to direct the server to perform arbitrary external requests, and then displays the full response to the user.
