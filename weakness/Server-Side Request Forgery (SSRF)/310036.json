I figured out we can perform blind SSRF using this exploit.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we use an https enabled website, We can trigger an SSL error which leads me to believe this website has the necessary capability to connect to other military websites either through the intranet or through clearnet. If we can query known military DNS it\u0026#39;ll time out confirming it exists. I can do this with any DoD IP thus an attacker can enumerate the DoD internal infrastructure.
