Anyway, glad a fix is available and was so easy to implement.\n\nThis is the response I was working on, most likely won't change your mind, but I put it out there just in case.\n \n\nThe only security concern possible is that curl stops and does not ever return, blocking whatever parent process/thread that triggered it, potentially leading to impacts to service availability of the system using curl.\n\n\nFrom the interactive CLI point of view that is not a problem as a user would just hit CTRL-C and they are out of the situation.  The errors reported should give the user a good clue to what is going on.\n\nFor persistent long running systems that have been designed to use the curl cli tool (instead of the proper libcurl), they are at risk when curl blocks.\n\nThese systems could over time accumulate a large number of curl processes that are hanging, potentially exhausting system resources, leading to a system crash/hang, denial of service, or loss of system availability.   Alternatively, in a different application type maybe only one curl process might end up blocking, but that curl process is in a critical thread of the application, rendering the system stalled until it unblocks.\n\n\nYes, I would agree that there should be some mitigations (for example, curl's own --max-time flag) that should prevent such process blocking issues from causing serious problems to an application. Unfortunitely, the --max-time flag does not work with this bug, it appears to be only in play during actual network transfers.  So only a careful developer using something outside of curl, like the coreutils \"timeout\" tool, could really prevent curl from blocking forever.

Anyway, glad a fix is available and was so easy to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the response I was working on, most likely won\u0026#39;t change your mind, but I put it out there just in case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only security concern possible is that curl stops and does not ever return, blocking whatever parent process/thread that triggered it, potentially leading to impacts to service availability of the system using curl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the interactive CLI point of view that is not a problem as a user would just hit CTRL-C and they are out of the situation.  The errors reported should give the user a good clue to what is going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor persistent long running systems that have been designed to use the curl cli tool (instead of the proper libcurl), they are at risk when curl blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese systems could over time accumulate a large number of curl processes that are hanging, potentially exhausting system resources, leading to a system crash/hang, denial of service, or loss of system availability.   Alternatively, in a different application type maybe only one curl process might end up blocking, but that curl process is in a critical thread of the application, rendering the system stalled until it unblocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I would agree that there should be some mitigations (for example, curl\u0026#39;s own --max-time flag) that should prevent such process blocking issues from causing serious problems to an application. Unfortunitely, the --max-time flag does not work with this bug, it appears to be only in play during actual network transfers.
