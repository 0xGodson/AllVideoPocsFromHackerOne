This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling as it is a non-standard interpretation of the header.\n\n**Description:** [add more details about this vulnerability]\nConsider an HTTP request with Content[CR]Length header . Suppose a proxy in front of node.js ignores the Content[CR]Length header (and therefore assumes a 0-length body). node, on the other hand, converts the CR to a hyphen and uses the value of the (newly formed...) Content-Length header. HTTP Request Smuggling ensues.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nThis is the HTTP stream that demonstrates the vulnerability:\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nContent[CR]Length: 42\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nGET /proxy_sees_this HTTP/1.1\nSomething: GET /node_sees_this HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\n\nA proxy server that ignores the invalid Content[CR]Length header will assume that the body length is 0 (since there's no body length indication), and will thus transmit the stream up to (but not including) the GET /proxy_sees_this. It will wait for node to respond (which interestingly does happen, even though node.js does expect the body - perhaps on GET requests, the URL is invoked regardless of the body?), then the proxy forwards the second request (from its perspective) - the GET /proxy_sees_this. Node then silently discards the expected 42 bytes of the body of the first request, and thus starts parsing the 2nd request from GET /node_sees_this.\nHTTP Request Smuggling ensues.\n\n[Also, if you were able to find the piece of code responsible for this issue, please add a link to it in the source repository.]\n\n## Impact: [add why this issue matters]\nHTTP Request Smuggling can lead to web cache poisoning, session hijacking, cross site scripting, etc.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * List any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, references, commits, code examples, etc.).\n\n## Impact\n\nHTTP Request Smuggling can lead to web cache poisoning, session hijacking, cross site scripting, etc.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNOTE!
