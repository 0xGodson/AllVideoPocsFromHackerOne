In the report #109161, since no \"token\" or secret data can be leaked through the Referer, the only think that the Referer can help to achieve would be to display a customized phishing page. The remediation is to use `noreferer` or a gateway page to avoid this leakage.\n\nIn your report, you explain that: *\"if the adversary register a similar phishing website the user won't be aware that he/she is going out of the trusted site\"*, which has basically the same impact: leading the user to go on a phishing page. However, *\"Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing)\"* are not part of our scope, and there are thousands of ways to make an user click on something linking to a phishing page (a tweet on a account linked to a profile on Gratipay…)\n\nIf you prefer, I can close this issue as \"Informative\" rather than \"Duplicate\".","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eTo my mind, the impact of the two reports is the same.
