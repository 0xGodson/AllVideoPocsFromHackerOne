I'm looking forward to see #76303 be publicly disclosed!\n\u003e\nWe can import reports for you, we link the reporter to a researcher by email. They will receive reputation and be listed on your program's HOF. I'm curious why you don't motivate researchers to report issues directly on HackerOne? We have some nice tools that help you identify signal and we have even more tools planned to help you respond to reports even faster!\n\u003e\nAbout recognizing researchers in your program. What we do in our own program: we add the researcher who submitted the duplicate report to the original report. You can simply do this by closing the report as a duplicate an tick the `Add _x_ to the original report` checkbox). The duplicate report gets `+2` instead of `+7` reputation, this can be fixed easily by reopening the duplicate and closing it as a resolved bug. If your program receives a lot of reports where multiple researchers are working on the same report, we could look into a more elegant solution. But so far we don't see much reports with true collaboration between researchers.\n\u003e\nHopefully this helps!

I\u0026#39;m looking forward to see \u003ca href=\"/reports/76303\"\u003e#76303\u003c/a\u003e be publicly disclosed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can import reports for you, we link the reporter to a researcher by email. They will receive reputation and be listed on your program\u0026#39;s HOF. I\u0026#39;m curious why you don\u0026#39;t motivate researchers to report issues directly on HackerOne? We have some nice tools that help you identify signal and we have even more tools planned to help you respond to reports even faster!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbout recognizing researchers in your program. What we do in our own program: we add the researcher who submitted the duplicate report to the original report. You can simply do this by closing the report as a duplicate an tick the \u003ccode\u003eAdd _x_ to the original report\u003c/code\u003e checkbox). The duplicate report gets \u003ccode\u003e+2\u003c/code\u003e instead of \u003ccode\u003e+7\u003c/code\u003e reputation, this can be fixed easily by reopening the duplicate and closing it as a resolved bug. If your program receives a lot of reports where multiple researchers are working on the same report, we could look into a more elegant solution. But so far we don\u0026#39;t see much reports with true collaboration between researchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully this helps!
