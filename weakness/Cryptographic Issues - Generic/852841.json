The numbers are not predictable, due to the use of [`random_int`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-int.php).\n\nMost notably the [`OC\\Security\\Crypto::encrypt`](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/92692cdd7ab42453b38f1ba684649c86f2d488c0/lib/private/Security/Crypto.php#L91) method uses an [IV](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/92692cdd7ab42453b38f1ba684649c86f2d488c0/lib/private/Security/Crypto.php#L97) with a [length of 16 bytes](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/92692cdd7ab42453b38f1ba684649c86f2d488c0/lib/private/Security/Crypto.php#L51). It is chosen randomly via `OC\\Security\\SecureRandom::generate` with the default character set. There are 256 possible bytes, but in this case it is *actually* 64 bytes. The permutations is 64^16 (instead of 256^16), which equates to a 12-byte, or 96-bit IV (instead of the expected 16-byte, or 128-bit IV). __Use raw bytes when doing cryptographic operations, via [`random_bytes`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-bytes.php).__\n\nDo not use `OC\\Security\\Crypto::generate` for cryptographic keys.\n\n\n### Cache Timing Attacks\n\nIt is *potentially* vulnerable to [cache timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack) because the secret number is used as an index to look up a byte value in string. [Read more about cache-timing attacks here](https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/its-all-about-time.html#Other-Types-Of-Timing-Attacks-Index-Lookup).\n\n## Impact\n\n1. Reduced permutations increase the chances of IV re-use (which can destroy confidentially), and bring encryption key strength down (chances are still too low with a 256-bit encryption key).\n\n2. If the complex cache timing attack vector exists, and is abused: it is possible to determine secret values generated with `OC\\Security\\SecureRandom::generate`.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"oc-security-securerandom-generate\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnextcloud%2Fserver%2Fblob%2F92692cdd7ab42453b38f1ba684649c86f2d488c0%2Flib%2Fprivate%2FSecurity%2FSecureRandom.php%23L49\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ccode\u003eOC\\Security\\SecureRandom::generate\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reduced-permutations\"\u003eReduced Permutations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eOC\\Security\\SecureRandom::generate\u003c/code\u003e will by default use \u003ccode\u003ea-Z0-9+/\u003c/code\u003e (64 bytes) character set.
