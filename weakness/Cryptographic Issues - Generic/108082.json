I think this is irresponsible and dangerous. Crypto is hard. Designing a crypto storage concept is not something you just come up with because you learned some crypto basics. I'd argue designing crypto storage may be even harder than crypto transport protocols, because there's much less research on it. (For an overview of the potential pitfalls I recommend this talk by Adam Langley [1].)\n\nIn conclusion: I think if a crypto protocol doesn't have the involvement of an expert (and by \"expert\" I mean someone whose name I have read multiple times in the past on crypto papers or relevant bug reports) you can be almost certain that it will not be secure.\n\nI haven't seen any obvious flaws in your new design on a first look (though I wonder why you chose to bake your own CTR+HMAC solution instead of using an AEAD cipher). But I think if you want to handle this issue responsible you basically have two options: Either ditch the crypto functionality or redesign it in cooperation with a crypto implementation expert.
