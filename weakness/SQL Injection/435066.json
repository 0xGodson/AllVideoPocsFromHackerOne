The investigation started on November 7th, but was pushed back due to the [SAML JIT incident](/reports/438306). **TL;DR: the SQL injection was not absued**. A more detailed answer can be found below.\n\nBased on the root cause of the vulnerability we identified a number of straightforward identifiers:\n\n - a `POST` request was made to `/graphql`\n - the `embedded_submission_form_uuid` parameter was passed in the URL or `POST` body (either as JSON or form encoded)\n - the user input must've contained a single quote in order to exploit the vulnerability\n\nThese identifiers helped us write a query to extract useful information from our Log Analysis Platform to see whether this was abused. We ran the query on the access logs from September 3rd, 2018 until October 8th, 2018. The query is slightly optimized and it took 00:06:34 to execute (it queries from both the hot and cold storage) and returned 104 matching requests.\n\n**Query**\n```\n██████████\n```\n\nThis query filters all requests to the `/graphql` endpoint with an embedded submission form UUID. The regular expression extracts the user input, decodes it, and constructs the executed SQL query. This helped us to immediately see what happened and determine whether someone purposely exploited this. We were also returning some more fields to help us figure out what the user would've seen, such as the HTTP response status code.\n\nSome interesting indicators that helped us here to determine whether this was abused: \n\n - the HTTP response status code (`code`) - in most cases it was a non-200 response, indicating that something went wrong. In most cases, this was related to a payload being used that would not work for PostgreSQL\n - the PoC that we developed ourselves executed the `pg_sleep` function - we used the `upstream_response_time`, `executedSqlQuery`, and `code` to determine whether the SQL was actually executed. Of the four `pg_sleep` functions we executed (`pg_sleep(1)`, `pg_sleep(5)`, `pg_sleep(10)`, and `pg_sleep(30)`), three were successful. The last one, with a timeout of 30, returned a 500 Internal Server Error because the backend aborted the request after 28 seconds.\n - in the logs, we found multiple scanners who tried to find a vulnerability. However, the majority of the scanners expect that the injection point is within a `WHERE` clause. In this case, the injection point was within a different context: `SET SESSION \u003cparameter\u003e TO '\u003cinjection\u003e'`. Because of this, automated scanners saw 500 Internal Server Errors and (most likely) didn't report a potential SQLi.\n\nThe **only** successful requests that were executed were our own `pg_sleep` payloads and came from trusted IP addresses.\n\nEarlier in this writeup, I wrote that one of the indicators was as following:\n\n - the `embedded_submission_form_uuid` parameter was passed in the URL or `POST` body (either as JSON or form encoded)\n\nThe underlying controller used the `params` object, which doesn't care where the user specified the parameter in the `POST` body or a URL (`GET`) parameter. This means that the nginx logs are not enough, as those don't log HTTP body data. The Rails logs do contain this information, but are harder to query, given that it's not in a JSON blob (**action item**: H1's security team prioritized a task to have a separate log pipeline that consists of JSON blogs). We've used the following query to filter the `embedded_submission_form_uuid` parameter from parameters Rails received:\n\n**Query**\n```\n██████████\n```\n\nThe result set was actually smaller (73 rows) than the initial results that were returned by the nginx access log query. We've looked into this and determined that not all requests from the load balancer were sent to unicorn and not all of the requests made it to Rails. This was not unexpected because nginx and/or Rack rejected some of the requests. We did not found any indicators that someone moved the parameters to the body. Here are the aggregated log counts per status code, which would also be a good indicator to see if this was abused:\n\n██████████\n\nNone of the requests showed any form of exploitation. This is why the team concluded that this wasn't abused.\n\nThe main takeaway from the root cause analysis and investigation is the reinforcement that building out an application log pipeline that includes all this information to be able to give an answer faster. The HackerOne security team has since prioritized building out these cohesive logs in a queryable format and has started collecting logs with enough context.\n\nThis incident will be played out again early next year as a table-top exercise to see how well we can respond to the same incident, but then with the new logs.","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eOn November 15th, we concluded the investigation to determine whether this has been abused.

This means that the nginx logs are not enough, as those don\u0026#39;t log HTTP body data.

We\u0026#39;ve looked into this and determined that not all requests from the load balancer were sent to unicorn and not all of the requests made it to Rails. This was not unexpected because nginx and/or Rack rejected some of the requests. We did not found any indicators that someone moved the parameters to the body.
