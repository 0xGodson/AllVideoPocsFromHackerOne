and clientSecret for a github oauth app hardcoded.\nWhile they have been removed a long time ago, they are still valid and usable and easy to be found in the git history.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nCheck each branch and each commit from the past and keep looking for anything that looks like a token.\nI did this automated using truffleHog

closer.\n\nThis allows to build an app that uses github authentication.\nAs per the screenshot attached this will looks as if this was really approved and made by Brendan Burns.\nI am not sure if this raises or lowers the risk this imposes as he is not directly the CNCF but indeed a pretty well known and trusted person inside the community.\nIf the user now clicks \"authenticate\" the attackers app follows the authentication flow further until https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#2-users-are-redirected-back-to-your-site-by-github where it receives an
