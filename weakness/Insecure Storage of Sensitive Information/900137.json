The portal also clearly indicates \"For Official Use Only - Privacy Sensitive\". Additionally, an attacker conveniently has access to export this data as a pdf, csv, or xls file, which makes data exfiltration easy. Note that this vulnerability appears to be very similar to report #808338. Please see the attached PoC videos (note that there are 2 videos because after I made the first video I realized I could scroll across and see the user's CAC User ID information, which seems very important in terms of logging into U.S. military systems).
