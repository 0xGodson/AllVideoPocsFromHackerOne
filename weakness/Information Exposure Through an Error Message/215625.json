[2015-12-10](https://travis-ci.org/rubysec/rubysec.github.io/jobs/95954424#L258)\n2. [2016-03-01](https://travis-ci.org/rubysec/rubysec.github.io/jobs/112766749#L319)\n\n**Description**\nThe token has `public_repo` [scope](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes), which means that it allows access to any *public* repos the owner account has access to, with the same permissions. This includes all public repositories under [Hacker0x01](https://github.com/Hacker0x01), for which Reed has full access: pull, push, as well as admin permissions.\n\n**Cause**\nThe cause of this as far as I can tell is incorrect  use of `git push` command in [the script](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/scripts/post-advisories.sh#L18):  passing a`-q`/`--quiet` option is not enough, as according to help it *“Suppresses all output \u003c…\u003e unless an error occurs”*, which happened in those two cases, in turn because of missing `--force` option.\n\n**Other**\nIn addition to revoking the token, you might want to review *any* commits to your repositories since the first exposure. The token allows to push from the Reeds account, but commit's author/committer can be set to anything. As far as I know, there's no UI on GitHUb to see what commits were *pushed* from the particular account.\n\nAlso, please, make sure not to disclose this issue publicly (including by accident, with a commit message, for example) at least for some time. Revoking/rotating token with a generic “updating the token” commit should be fine though, as generally nobody pays attention to them.\n\nNote, that I've contacted GitHub to perform mass revocation of credentials that I found, but they aren't as fast as I hoped, so meanwhile I'm trying to notify affected parties individually.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA HackerOne employee Reed Loden (\u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Freedloden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGitHub:reedloden\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) exposed their personal access token twice in build logs of the \u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frubysec%2Frubysec.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003erubysec/rubysec.github.io\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e project:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftravis-ci.org%2Frubysec%2Frubysec.github.io%2Fjobs%2F95954424%23L258\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2015-12-10\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftravis-ci.org%2Frubysec%2Frubysec.github.io%2Fjobs%2F112766749%23L319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2016-03-01\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDescription\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe token has \u003ccode\u003epublic_repo\u003c/code\u003e \u003ca href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.github.com%2Fv3%2Foauth%2F%23scopes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003escope\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which means that it allows access to any \u003cem\u003epublic\u003c/em\u003e repos the owner account has access to, with the same permissions.
