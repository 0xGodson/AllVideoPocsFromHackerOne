Then they create an ingress with the remainder of the name and a passwd file of their choosing, this overwrites the other namespace's passwd file and effectively removes the auth layer provided by nginx ingress.\n\n## Kubernetes Version:\n$ kubectl version\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"16+\", GitVersion:\"v1.16.5-beta.0\", GitCommit:\"224be7bdce5a9dd0c2fd0d46b83865648e2fe0ba\", GitTreeState:\"archive\", BuildDate:\"2019-12-31T22:42:08Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.12.13\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"16\", GitVersion:\"v1.16.2\", GitCommit:\"c97fe5036ef3df2967d086711e6c0c405941e14b\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2019-10-15T19:09:08Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.12.10\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\n\nInstalled via kubeadm on gentoo (though I don't think this is relevant to vulnerability).\n\n## Component Version:\nquay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-controller:0.26.1\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n  1. Install nginx ingress\n  2. Create namespace a and ingress b-c within a with an auth annotation.\n  3. Create namespace a-b and ingress c within a-b with an auth annotation that overrides the passwd file from #2.\n  4.

Create folder to go along with.\n3. Check that the folder and file will actually be in the right location (.. is allowed as a namespace).\n\n## Impact\n\nAttacker can override the htpasswd file of another ingress effectively neutralizing the http authentication.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eReport Submission Form\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse of nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth* annotations results in a file named {namespace}-{ingress}.passwd.
