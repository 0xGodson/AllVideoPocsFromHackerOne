Normally Session Fixation is boring but I discovered a way to simply use by-design XSS to authenticate as a user on those affected apps.\n\n#Details\nAs the policy pointed out XSS on *.shopifycloud.com and *.shopifyapps.com are N/A. That means finding XSS on them should be fairly trivial. Anyway after the XSS on embedded SDK I started to think what I can do with it. I played around some other shopify-built apps and discovered that some of them use signed session and the other use session id. Looking further I realized some which use session id do not generate a new session id after logging in. They are basically assigning the login status in whatever session id you provide in the cookie header. A straight-out Session Fixation. For example, in Shopify Flow, when you hit the index page, a `_flow_session` cookie is assigned. When you log in (/auth/callback), the session doesn't change. As an attacker, if I can write my session id cookie to your browser and you log in, I can use the session id to authenticate as you.\n\nSo the attack goes like this:\n1. Attacker goes to Shopify Flow and copies the session id it generates\n2. Attacker uses XSS on *.shopifycloud.com and writes the cookie scoped to all subdomain to victim `document.cookie='_flow_session=EVIL;domain=.shopifycloud.com;path=/';`\n3. Attacker forces victim to log into Shopify Flow (i.e. https://www.shopify.com/admin/apps/flow which redirects to VICTIM_STORE.shopify.com/admin/apps/flow which triggers the login flow)\n4. Attacker can now use the session to authenticate as victim\n\n#Steps to Reproduce\n1. Be logged into your store as an admin and have Shopify Flow installed\n2. Navigate to https://poorvictim.myshopify.com/products/canvas\n3. After a while it should redirect to the Shopify Flow page\n4. (Attacker) Use another browser, go to https://flow.shopifycloud.com/robots.txt and run this code in console `document.cookie='_flow_session=7b2f6c606fab4186d7be385aa66d53d9'`\n5. (Attacker) Navigate to https://flow.shopifycloud.com/?shop=YOUR_STORE.myshopify.com and you should see your (Victim) data for a split second (you are supposed to use this in iframe) (Remember to change the YOUR_STORE in the URL)\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can authenticate as the victim.\n\nI have found Session Fixation on the following apps:\n* Shopify Flow\n* Transporter \n* Launchpad\n\nThere are probably some others I haven't tested or forgotten. Let me know if you want me to list them all.\n\nI'm also looking if there's some subdomains on *.shopify.com that suffer from it.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eHi team!,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m reporting a Session Fixation issue on multiple shopify-built apps hosted on *.shopifycloud.com and *.shopifyapps.com.
