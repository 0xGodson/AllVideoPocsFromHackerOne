Just like every other clickjacking issue, all of the issues I found rely on the ignorance of the user into visiting a link, while they are currently logged into yelp. Technically, an attacker can trick a yelp user to do anything or everything that they normally can do but wouldn't do, so this is like a CSRF attack, but it's worse than CSRF, as usually CSRF only causes one specific issue, but the clickjacking attack I have demonstrated here, can lead to many issues for Yelp users. Due to limited time and resource, I selected three issues to demonstrate and I recorded some videos to demonstrate them, but if needed, I can certainly demonstrate more issues due to this same vulnerability. Here are the introduction of the videos recorded in this report:\n\nTricking a user into unknowingly;\nNo.1: bookmarking unwanted business'\nNo.2: adding events to their profile they are interested in attending.\nNo. 3: editing their star rating on reviews;\n\nMore detailed explanation to each video:\nNo.1 trick_user_bookmark : This one is tricking the victim into bookmarking a page that they really may not want to have on their account.

Although the review will still sound positive, the rating of the company will not reflect on that.\n\nNo.4 trick_user_to_edit_review_withyelp_transparent = shows the vulnerability happening, while the user cannot see the yelp page. This one is pretty much the same as video No.3, but this time I made yelp.com transparent, so it is what would happen in real world attacks.
