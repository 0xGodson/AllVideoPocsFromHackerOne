We ensured that those who reported actionable tokens quickly, such as yourself, received a bounty, in order to be fair, but this is not a case where one researcher got a bounty that another researcher could have received. More specifically, regardless of how many tokens were included in a report, \u003cstrong\u003eno one researcher was going to receive more than a single bounty for reporting API tokens exposed in \u003ccode\u003estrings.xml\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.
