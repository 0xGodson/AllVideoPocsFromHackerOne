But,if user again wants to create an another account using his personal mail address,his mail address will not be accepted to sign up.(as a result,users will also suffer regarding this issue).\n                  (d)whenever a user mail id is updated by the attacker,the \"your email has changed\" mail should be sent to the user,because who knows may be attacker has taken control over victim's
