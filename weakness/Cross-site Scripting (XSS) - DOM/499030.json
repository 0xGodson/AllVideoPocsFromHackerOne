I have done so for the sake of a good POC,  but the registration process is slow. I will comment on this issue when the POC is live.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n0. Wait for the POC to be live (registration of my .ma domain is in progress)\n1. Browse to my POC running on https://app-sj17.ma/marketo/post2.html (note that this is literally the POC written by @adac95)\n2. Note the malicous redirect is still successfully executed;\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the www.hackerone.com application, if the victim user makes use of a browser which does not support CSP. The attacker could also perform a limited phishing attack in Firefox or Microsoft Edge.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe security fix by Marketo to resolve the issue reported by \u003ca href=\"/adac95\"\u003e@adac95\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ca href=\"/reports/398054\"\u003e#398054\u003c/a\u003e can be bypassed by purchasing an .ma domain for €60.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDescription\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe issues described by \u003ca href=\"/adac95\"\u003e@adac95\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ca href=\"/reports/398054\"\u003e#398054\u003c/a\u003e remain insufficiently resolved because of an inadequate security check by Marketo in the following piece of JavaScript in \u003ccode\u003eforms2.min.js\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight javascript\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan class=\"k\"\u003eif\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eoriginalEvent\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eoriginalEvent\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003edata\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"mi\"\u003e0\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e===\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ei\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eindexOf\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eoriginalEvent\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eorigin\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e))\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"kd\"\u003evar\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eb\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e;\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"k\"\u003etry\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eb\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ej\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eparseJSON\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eoriginalEvent\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003edata\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"k\"\u003ecatch\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ec\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan class=\"k\"\u003ereturn\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eb\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003emktoReady\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e?\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ef\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e()\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eb\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003emktoResponse\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003ee\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003eb\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nx\"\u003emktoResponse\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the variable \u003ccode\u003ei\u003c/code\u003e resolves to \u003ccode\u003ehttps://app-sj17.marketo.com/[...]\u003c/code\u003e, an attacker can bypass this check by registering the Marcarian domain \u003ccode\u003eapp-sj17.ma\u003c/code\u003e for €60.
