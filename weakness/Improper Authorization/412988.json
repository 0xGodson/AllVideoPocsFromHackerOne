This vulnerability was fixed on October 25th and we missed closing it. You\u0026#39;re right that the mediation requests endpoint can still be viewed. Now that a user won\u0026#39;t be able to request mediation anymore for published reports, we\u0026#39;re OK with that. We may fix that at some point. Thanks again for bringing this to our attention.
