Following the walkthrough section above\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\nIf this is intended behavior you should be aware of the types of attacks that can be performed via this behavior and take appropriate measures. These measures might include blocking network access from the application server to other internal systems, and hardening the application server itself to remove any services available on the local loopback adapter.\n\nIf the ability to trigger arbitrary external service interactions is not intended behavior, then you should implement a whitelist of permitted services and hosts, and block any interactions that do not appear on this whitelist.\n\nResources:\n\nhttps://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00300200_external-service-interaction-dns#:~:text=Description%3A%20External%20service%20interaction%20(DNS,a%20web%20or%20mail%20server.\u0026text=The%20ability%20to%20send%20requests,used%20as%20an%20attack%20proxy.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe ability to send requests to other systems can allow the vulnerable server to be used as an attack proxy.
