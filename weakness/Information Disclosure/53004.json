A [comment](https://hackerone.com/reports/47368#activity-329823) by **aianus**  states that callbacks are now restricted *\"from hitting any RFC 6890 IP addresses and networks\"*. This security measure can be bypassed used DNS rebinding.\r\n\r\n Let's consider what happens where an URL like http://test42.sqli.nicob.net/_hostmanager/healthcheck is submitted via the \"Merchants settings\":\r\n1) The hostname \"test42.sqli.nicob.net\" is resolved (twice) by your servers.
