This url is clearly expecting a HTTP GET parameter offasgid with some base64 encoded value. Decoding this value, you get 2008021857 . The █████ in question was my first █████ from February 2008. From testing several IDs, I determined the format is {year}{██████████ #} so 2008, ████████ # 021857.  I simply incremented this value to 2008021858, base64 encoded this value, and browsed to https://███/portal/viewrfo.aspx?offasgid=MjAwODAyMTg1Ng==  . Here, I was able to see ███████.  I also tested the next value ( https://███/portal/viewrfo.aspx?offasgid=MjAwODAyMTg1NQ== ) and got █████. Finally, I opened a new private browser window (so no cookies) and browsed directly to that last link. I had to reauthenticate, but I then was able to directly assess ██████████. At this point, I stopped interacting with the website to submit this vulnerability. \n\nNOTE: I did not save any record of these ███████s outside except the single attached screenshot.\nNOTE2: I tried a couple more values during this write-up to better understand the ID. I initially thought the 02 from 2008021858 was the month {year}{month}{id} but its just {year}{id}. I used 2018000001 and ended up with an ████████ from 20171001 (the very first day of the 2018 fiscal year). I also tested a couple IDs to see how far back the data goes. I used 1999000001 to pull an ██████ from 19980327. I believe this is the very first █████ in the system. I tried 1997000001 as well, and it simply returned a blank ████ (i.e. the ID does not exist).\n\n## Impact\nIn a relatively simple and predictable manner (due to the sequential IDs), any user with access to █████ can incrementally view every ███ issued by ████████ dating back to 1998. This data includes SSN last 4, EFMP information, branch, and assignment information. From this data, one can extract all sorts of information about the U.S. █████████ personnel including total ██████████ strength, ████ strength by branch, assignment history, strength by base, etc.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1.

Browse to any █████████ you want to view like https://████/portal/viewrfo.aspx?offasgid=MjAxOTAxMDg2NQ== if you want to view my most recent ███.\n3. Modify offasgid value as desired to view any other ███████ (they seem to be incrementing IDs by year)\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nFirst, the offasgid needs to be random and not a predictable value.
