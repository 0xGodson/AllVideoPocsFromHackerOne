An attacker could for example read your email, or simply retrieve a local password store/cookies etc. After retrieving the desired data/file it can exfiltrate it out of the local-sandbox to a remote recourse (server from the attacker) using the same vector.\r\n\r\n2719 is a vulnerability which can mount a Flash applet from a http:// or https:// origin in the local-with-file-sandbox  mode, which is normally only used for files opened locally on the users file-system. Due to this issue the other 2720 vulnerability can be linked in such a way that it is remotely exploitable.\r\n\r\nBy mounting 2719 before 2720 the user does not have to download anything, accept anything.\r\nThe vulnerability requires no additional user interaction, simply visiting the site prepared to serve the exploit is enough.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are already reported  to Adobe and will be patched next week's patch Tuesday (June 10).
