This can lead to disclosure of location where photo was taken or other personal information by the photo uploader if their group is public, as anyone can download the logo and check the metadata.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Upload a testing image w any EXIF tags filled in (you can test with the attached download.jpg image on this report)\n2. Make the group public\n3. Visit the group page unauthenticated and download the image\n4. Use Windows properties tool or any EXIF viewer, check the metadata. Whatever was there when uploaded should be there when downloaded, including the exact file name (though the file name part isn't an actual reportable problem, it's good practice to just encode/make it a random file name in case the user uploading forgets to remove personal information in the file name)\n\n## PoC\nCheck out my group: https://gitlab.com/gthgh\nTry downloading the logo.
