For the benefit of @nismo, I will clarify my doubts here as well.\n\nI think the thing that I (and perhaps @nismo) are most confused about is the distinction between private and sandboxed programs. I understand from your program's policy that information disclosures that do not distinguish between these types of programs are considered out of scope. \n\nSeeing that the previous report #342978, in which both @nismo and I had filed duplicates on, made use of a similar property (in that case `whitelisted_hackers`) to identify if an external program was actually running a private program, what is the exact difference between that report and this report, _in terms of distinguishing between sandboxed and private programs_?\n\nBased on your explanation, let me try to see if what I understood is correct: \n\n1. Sandboxed programs cannot accept submissions from the general public, while \"private programs\" (in your terminology) refers to programs that _do_ accept submissions, regardless of whether the program is viewable (i.e. external program).\n2. The `whitelisted_hackers` field only applies to \"private programs\", since this count supposedly only counts invited researchers.\n3. Meanwhile, the absence of `FEATURE_GATED` from `i_cannot_create_jira_webhook_reasons` can show that a program exists under the handle, regardless if it is sandboxed or \"private\".\n\nTherefore, what you're saying is that:\n\n1. _There is no vulnerability_ if we can tell if an external program is running a program that hasn't been launched\n2. _There is a vulnerability_ if we can tell whether an external program is \"private\" or sandboxed, i.e. whether they are a paying customer\n\nI think the reason why we are confused is that we don't have any examples of what a sandboxed (and not \"private\") program looks like. In addition, in report #342978 you said (and I quote):\n\n\u003e this issue can be used to determine whether external programs in our Directory are running private programs\n\nThis led us to believe that there is indeed a vulnerability if we could tell if an external program was running a program under the handle, since we could already tell that some of them (notably ████, or companies with their own bug bounty programs like ██████ and █████████) would not have a private program in HackerOne. The findings in this report as well as my own duplicate in #349172 were based on this assumption.\n\nIt would be helpful if you could confirm/provide a precise definition of the four states of a program you are referring to, in order to avoid future invalid reports.\n\nThanks once again, and sorry for the long reply!","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHi \u003ca href=\"/jobert\"\u003e@jobert\u003c/a\u003e, thanks so much for spending time to go through our reports.
