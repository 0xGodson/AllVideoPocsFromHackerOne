An attacker can intercept the query to the page and insert an XSS payload, as shown in ██████████. \n\nThis input is then displayed back to the user, popping up the XSS payload ██████████. The XSS payload is actually inserted a number of times into the resulting HTML, which can be seen in ████████. This results in numerous pop ups to the user. \n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nWhile intercepting requests with a proxy such as Burp, carry out the following steps\n\n1. Visit the page at https://██████/usnotice.php\n2. Select a value from the drop down list and press \"View Now\"\n3. Add an XSS payload to the POST parameters,  eg, ``\u003cscript\u003ealert('xss')\u003c/script\u003e``\n4. Observe on the next page the XSS pop-ups\n\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nAny user controlled input should be filtered by the application to remove special characters such as  ``\u003c`` and ``\u003e``, as well as special words such as ``script``. \n\nFor further guidance, see: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html\n\n## Impact\n\nIn this instance, the only person the XSS affects is myself, ie, Self-XSS. This could be weaponised to affect other users though, for example by being placed in a web form on an attacker controlled page, then tricking a user to click the link to visit the .mil page.
