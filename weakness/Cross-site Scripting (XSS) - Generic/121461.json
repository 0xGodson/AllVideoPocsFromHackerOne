Obviously this is not the case any longer, as the bucket is now claimed and serving a fake login page (see \"Attack Scenario\").\n- I created a bucket with name \"a2.bime.io\" on my S3 account in the US East 1 region.\n- I enabled static website hosting and pointed \"index.html\" as the index document.\n- Then I uploaded `index.html` (attached to this report) and clicked \"Make public\" to make sure it can be served. \n- Now go to http://a2.bime.io and you will see a BIME login page. Click the Sign In button and you will notice it is a fake login form. \n\n# Attack Scenario \nI created a false login page and posted it on http://a2.bime.io. The login page looks just like the normal BIME sign in page, but it is 100% controlled by the attacker. The attacker could harvest logins by convincing their victims to visit the fake login page. Since it is a subdomain of `bime.io`, which BIME customers will recognize, it is likely they will fall for the attack. \n\nI have attached the fake login page here as `index.html`.\n\n# Remediation\nRemove the `a2.bime.io` DNS entry so it no longer points to an S3 bucket Zendesk Ops doesn't control. If you need me to release `a2.bime.io` as an S3 bucket, let me know and I'll delete the bucket.\n\n","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eI noticed BIME is primarily built on Amazon AWS, which spawned my interest.
