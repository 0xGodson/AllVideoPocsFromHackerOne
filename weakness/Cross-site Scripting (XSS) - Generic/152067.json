Are you saying you\u0026#39;ve stopped doing that now, and aren\u0026#39;t interested in future attacks like this one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s my understanding (and I\u0026#39;ve done a quick check of the codebase) that \u003ccode\u003edeveloper.uber.com\u003c/code\u003e no longer serves content from \u003ccode\u003euber.readme.io\u003c/code\u003e and is hosted in-house now. As a result we won\u0026#39;t pay out for new issues on \u003ccode\u003ereadme.io\u003c/code\u003e. Though I\u0026#39;m sure \u003ca title=\"support@readme.io\" href=\"mailto:support@readme.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003esupport@readme.io\u003c/a\u003e would be interested and we really appreciate the detailed reports that you\u0026#39;ve sent in so far!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m very happy with this payout and will keep hacking away, but I\u0026#39;m puzzled that this got a lower payout than \u003ca title=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/131450\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/131450\"\u003ehttps://hackerone.com/reports/131450\u003c/a\u003e since the impact is pretty much identical. Did the last report get more because it was a chained exploit or is there a mitigating factor I didn\u0026#39;t notice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned above, we\u0026#39;ve now moved \u003ccode\u003edeveloper.uber.com\u003c/code\u003e off \u003ccode\u003ereadme.io\u003c/code\u003e. We were already in the process of doing that when this report was received. In fact, by the time this report reached the developers we had already migrated (hence the jump to \u003ccode\u003eResolved\u003c/code\u003e state). We decided to pay out this report in good faith since you couldn\u0026#39;t have known that when the report was submitted, but paid a slightly lower bounty as this was resolved as a result of an migration that was already in process (i.e. there was no direct patch on our end). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan we publicly disclose this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSure thing, approving now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eP.S.
