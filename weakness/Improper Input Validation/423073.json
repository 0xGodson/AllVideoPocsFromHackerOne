After you completed the retest for #419896 we realized that your comment was actually a bypass for the original fix. Because of the input validation we used for the other endpoint we determined that this had something to do with the way the null bytes were (incorrectly) interpreted. However, when we looked into another endpoint that was vulnerable to the same issue, we determined that this was not the case. Here's a technical writeup what happened exactly and why your comment bypassed the fix.\n\nConsider the following controller method:\n\n```ruby\ndef some_method\n  return unless params[:something].present?\n\n  SomeObject.where something: params[:something]\nend\n```\n\nThe `SomeObject` model is implemented as the code shown below. Notice that the `something` column is of type `uuid`.\n\n```ruby\nclass SomeObject \u003c ApplicationRecord\nend\n\n# == Schema Information\n#\n# Table name: some_objects\n#\n#  id                        :integer          not null, primary key\n#  something                 :uuid\n```\n\nAt first sight, it seems that there's no way the `where` method call would ever execute the following query due to the `present?` check:\n\n```sql\nSELECT some_objects.* FROM some_objects WHERE something IS NULL\n```\n\nIt turns out that `uuid` columns behaves different from a `text`, `int`, or `varchar` column. ActiveRecord determines whether the user input is actually a valid UUID format. In case it isn't, it'll coerce the input to nil, which causes the constructed query to execute an `IS NULL` query instead of an exact text match on the given value.\n\nHere's a copy from a Rails console to show this behavior:\n\n```\n[1] pry(main)\u003e SomeObject.where(something: \"aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaa\").to_sql\n=\u003e \"SELECT \\\"some_objects\\\".* FROM \\\"some_objects\\\" WHERE \\\"some_objects\\\".\\\"something\\\" = 'aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaa'\"\n[2] pry(main)\u003e SomeObject.where(something: \"zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzzzz\").to_sql\n=\u003e \"SELECT \\\"some_objects\\\".* FROM \\\"some_objects\\\" WHERE \\\"some_objects\\\".\\\"something\\\" IS NULL\"\n```\n\nThis was rather unexpected. The regular expression that we implemented matched on `a-z0-9` instead of `a-f0-9`, so an attacker could've picked any valid UUID and changed a single character to a `z` to fool the input validation, invalidate the UUID, and then execute the `IS NULL` query.\n\nAll in all, this was a valid bypass for the original security vulnerability, which is why we'll be awarding you with a $7,500 bounty.
