Assume that you are not invited to [███████](https://hackerone.com/██████████) private program private program, first step, use the publish feature, go here: https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/publish\n2. Submit a publish report, put ████████ (███████) in Program (see below), put any test details and hit `Publish Vulnerability`.\n████\n3. Now the vulnerability is under `Pending review` by a moderator\n4. Send a test mail to `hackerone@████.com` to get an invitation to submit a report, accept the invitation and you will become a participant of the said private program.\n5. After that you will observed after how many hours, it will show on the private program hacktivity page your publish report will show as `resolved` ███████ and displayed on their hacktivity timeline,

so many report that was submitted and resolved.\n\nThis will also manipulate the hacker profile to show that he/she have many report that was submitted and resolved to a particular private
