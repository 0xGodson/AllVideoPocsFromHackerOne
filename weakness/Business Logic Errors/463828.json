We've pushes a fix for the underlying problem you reported to us. A couple weeks ago a change was made to the ACLs that allowed a user to view a program's profile when they **ever** submitted a report to a program through an embedded submission form. This didn't look an issue at first sight, because the same information is disclosed through the GraphQL endpoint when you provide an embedded submission form UUID. However, the difference was that the ACL granted someone access, even when the submission form was deleted, whereas the information was not disclosed anymore through GraphQL when it was deleted. We've fixed this by not allowing someone to view the program's profile anymore when they have submitted a report through an embedded submission form. Good luck and happy hacking!","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHi \u003ca href=\"/haxta4ok00\"\u003e@haxta4ok00\u003c/a\u003e - thanks again for bringing this to our attention!
