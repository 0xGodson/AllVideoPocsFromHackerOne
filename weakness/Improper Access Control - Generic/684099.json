Get the APK of periscope app you can use any of the tool to get the APK from the device for this POC i have used \"APK Extractor\" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ext.ui\u0026hl=en\n\n2.

Go to the res/values/strings.xml and look for this and search for \"firebase\" keyword\n\n4. And you will find this URL \"https://████\"\n\n5. Next, go to the browser and paste this URL \"https://█████/.json\"\n\n6. You will observe \"null\" response will come, so it means the firebase database is public but in general, it should show \"Permission Denied\" based on the firebase database rule. https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules\n\n##Security Impact\nAs it's public now it's very simple for the attacker to perform queries into the database. In my POC I took the approach to make one Android application to insert a sample data to confirm the takeover.\n\n###Android Code Snippet\n`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\npublic class SampleFirebaseActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_sample_firebase);\n\n        Firebase.setAndroidContext(this);\n        Firebase.getDefaultConfig().setPersistenceEnabled(true);\n\n        Firebase firebase = new Firebase(\"https://████████/\");\n\n        firebase.child(\"test\").setValue(\"Periscope Firebase Database take over by Deeptiman Pattnaik\");\n        \n    }\n}\n`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nThe above application doesn't need any acces_token to insert data to the firebase database it's completely open and anybody can access it without any access credentials.\n\nSo in order to avoid this type of vulnerability, it's always better to make the rules of the database to private.\n\n\nThanks\nDeeptiman Pattnaik\n","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHello \u003ca href=\"/bugtriage-sophia\"\u003e@bugtriage-sophia\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for the reply, please follow the below to reproduce the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"steps-to-reproduce\"\u003eSteps to reproduce\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet the APK of periscope app you can use any of the tool to get the APK from the device for this POC i have used \u0026quot;APK Extractor\u0026quot; \u003ca title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ext.ui\u0026amp;hl=en\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.ext.ui%26hl%3Den\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ext.ui\u0026amp;hl=en\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecompile the APK using apktool, follow the below command to extract the source code from the APK.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca title=\"https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fibotpeaches.github.io%2FApktool%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eapktool d Periscope_tv.periscope.android.apk -o ████\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eGo to the res/values/strings.xml and look for this and search for \u0026quot;firebase\u0026quot; keyword\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you will find this URL \u0026quot;https://████\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext, go to the browser and paste this URL \u0026quot;https://█████/.json\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou will observe \u0026quot;null\u0026quot; response will come, so it means the firebase database is public but in general, it should show \u0026quot;Permission Denied\u0026quot; based on the firebase database rule. \u003ca title=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules\" href=\"/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffirebase.google.com%2Fdocs%2Frules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://firebase.google.com/docs/rules\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"security-impact\"\u003eSecurity Impact\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs it\u0026#39;s public now it\u0026#39;s very simple for the attacker to perform queries into the database.

It allows an attacker to store highly sensitive compromised data in the Periscope Firebase database anonymously. \n\n An attacker can store many different forms of data in this Firebase database such as -: malicious links, stolen credit card details, user's stolen email's password or some organization's financial information.\n\nMost importantly Firebase allows to store hyperlink in the database, so it's an open advantage for the attacker to design an application to fool the end-user to click on the suspicious links unknowingly. Whereas there is no way of accusing the anonymous attackers of owning the data being stored in the Periscope Firebase database because the complete proprietary owner of the database belongs to Twitter. It will cause severe damage to Twitter's public reputation and may follow a lawsuit from the federal authority for allowing or giving open access to any anonymous attackers store records illegally. \n\n\n###Recent Attacks\n\nThere are some recent attacks occurred for Firebase database misconfiguration and allowing any user to access companies records publicly.

How does your organization ensure user transparency and control around data use?\n2. Are you sure that your organization has the right consents in a place where these are needed under the GDPR?\n3. Does your organization have the right systems to record user preferences and consents?\n4. How will you show regulators and partners that you meet the principles of the GDPR and are an accountable organization?\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nI will highly recommend following the below guidelines available for Firebase GDPR ready.\n\n1. https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy\n2. https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr-firebase-dpo/\n3. https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms\n\nAnd one more thing I'd like to point out that this Firebase database link is found in the production periscope Android app, so it's a live database and it needs to be configured securely. And as always it's a best practice to secure companies property properly.\n\nPlease go through the above details and let me know.\n\nThanks\nDeeptiman Pattnaik\n\n","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHello \u003ca href=\"/jwaddle\"\u003e@jwaddle\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, it\u0026#39;s very simple to understand that,   the criticality of an open database with large storage space.
