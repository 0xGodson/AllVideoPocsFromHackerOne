The user granted access could download an offline copy  and refer to it after share access expires.\n\nWhere this issue becomes more concerning is with \"living\" files that an individual might frequently edit, like a spreadsheet. A share recipient could extend their access and continue to view updated file contents until someone noticed the share instance was still in place.\n\nThis does not appear to affect groups; i.e. if a group is the recipient of a share I have not been able to successfully invoke this vulnerability as a group member.\n\nIf I can provide any further information or help with proof of concept please let me know.
