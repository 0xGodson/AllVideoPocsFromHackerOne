This discloses some sensitive informations: \n\n* New hire information ( due to onsite interviews )\n* Internal presentation ( we found at least one internal presentation that we could access )\n* Zoom meetings link - These meetings can be accessed without login which puts a lot of internal information at risk. \n\n\n**Description**\n\nFor the analysis of this, we used Hunter.io's API to get list of all @shopify.com emails that it had (this does not mean we queried every existent shopify.com emails). After we had done that, we ran it through a Google Calendar feature that allows adding other people's calendar.
