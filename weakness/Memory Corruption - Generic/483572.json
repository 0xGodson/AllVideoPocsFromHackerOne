How could a Memory Corruption Vulnerability in an Intel Product priced at $2949 with a valid Vulnerability have a severity set as None?\n\n2) You mentioned that \"This reward is outside of the normal criteria for our Bug Bounty program, which is focused on rewarding valid security vulnerabilities in Intel products, and should be considered an exception.\" BUT, I noticed a similar Vulnerability (Heap Overflow local vector) in the Same Product reported by another Hackerone Researcher and Acknowledged by Intel Security Team in 2018. The link to the Intel Security Advisory is https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00180.html, bearing CVE ID CVE-2018-12174 and the respective Researcher was https://hackerone.com/jplopezy. Could you please explain \n\n3) I have several more Vulnerabilities in Intel VTune Amplifier, Intel Trace Analyzer, Intel System Studio, Intel Parallel Studio, Intel OpenVINO toolkit, Intel Quartus Prime, Intel Media Server Studio and several other Intel Paid Products. Are they also Out-Of-Scope for the Intel Bug Bounty Program? \n\n4) Both this report #483572 and  #483573 are different since the Binaries in question are different, the PoCs are different, the crash location is different. One report is for the \"Intel Trace Collector Application\" and the other is for the \"Intel Trace Analyzer Application\". Could you share the root cause as to how report #483573 was closed as Duplicate of this report. \n\nI am attaching both the 2018 Intel Advisory for this \"Same product\" and the Hackerone Researcher's profile page who reported that other Vulnerability to Intel Security Team along with this comment.\n\nIt is extremely disheartening to see Intel first downplay the Severity in the CVSS scoring, thereafter merge two distinctly different issues into one and thereafter say that the Vulnerability is out of normal scope and an exception is being made when clearly a similar vulnerability in the same product has been fixed and acknowledged by Intel just 3 months ago. \n\nI hope some clarity can be brought into this matter, so that I can responsibly report the other findings I have found \"if they are in scope of this program without any exceptions\".\n\nEagerly awaiting your response.\n\nThanking You,\n\nYours Sincerely,\nKushal Arvind Shah.\nSenior Security Researcher | Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs.","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHello Alan Mc Ninch, Intel Product Security Team,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGood Evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, I would like to thank you for responding, I sincerely appreciate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, I would like to request for a response to the following:-\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1) The severity was recently updated from from Medium to None for a CVSS 3.0 score of 4.2 Medium Memory Corruption Vulnerability in a commercial /paid Intel Product.
