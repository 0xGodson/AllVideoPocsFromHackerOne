This is a well known and high/critical vector of attack that often can completely compromise the security of a web application or in some cases lead to Remote Code Execution (although I do not expect it to be an easy RCE in this case).\n\nDescription:\n========\nThe XML External Entity Execution allows for arbitrary reading of files on the server using a relatively obscure aspect of the XML language. It is generally considered high or critical severity, most notably Google places it at the same severity as remote code execution because of the potential for Server-Side Request Forgery, Remote Code Exection, and arbitrary File Read.\n\nThe mitigating factors here for you are that some account priveleges are required to upload tranlation files, although by default this gets rolled into the @Translate group. Also because your web server is python based it is not vulnerable to the trivial RCE that PHP servers are commonly vulnerable to.\n\nThe core of the vulnerability is in how the translate-toolkit processes .XLF files. The XLIFF standard is XML based, and thus supports by default standard XML functionality including external entity execution.\n\nIn my proof of concept, I dowloaded as .XLF the translations of the \"hello\" project which is being pointed to by my local Weblate instance.
