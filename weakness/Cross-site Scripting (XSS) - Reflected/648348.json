This includes access to the user’s cookies. Cookies are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user’s session cookie, they can impersonate that user, perform actions on behalf of the user, and gain access to the user’s sensitive data.\n- JavaScript can read the browser DOM and make arbitrary modifications to it. Luckily, this is only possible within the page where JavaScript is running.\n- JavaScript can use the XMLHttpRequest object to send HTTP requests with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations.\n- JavaScript in modern browsers can use HTML5 APIs. For example, it can gain access to the user’s geolocation, webcam, microphone, and even specific files from the user’s file system. Most of these APIs require user opt-in, but the attacker can use social engineering to go around that limitation.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eI will combine this vulnerability with this vulnerability (described in this report \u003ca href=\"/reports/648222\"\u003e#648222\u003c/a\u003e).
