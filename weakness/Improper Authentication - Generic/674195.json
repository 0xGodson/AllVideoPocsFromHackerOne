The attacker can now purchase plans using victim's credit card\n- Attacker has also a list of teams victim is owner, when she purchases a new plan.\n\nIf attacker wants to purchase a plan for her own group, she can nominate victim owner, so now attacker's group will be in the dropdown, buy the plan, remove the victim.\n\n### Examples\n\nI attached a video with all these attacks, sorry but it is a bit messy.\nOn the left there is victim's browser, on the right attacker's browser. When it appears a console, is for the attacker's browser. The attacker's is in a private session, so it is completely separated from the victim.\n\n0:00-0:10: we see victim has a subscription, and attacker no.
