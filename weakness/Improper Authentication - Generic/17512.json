Valid email-id which is registered on hackerone.\r\n\r\nNow, chaining from my previously i.e lately reported bugs.\r\nUser enumeration attack I reported recently.\r\n\r\nOne can find a registered email easily. eg michiel@hackerone.com or jobert@hackerone.com\r\n\r\nBasic Idea :\r\n==========\r\n1. I am requesting a 'Reset Password link' to user's email. \r\neg.\r\nhttps://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\n2. Guessing the reset_password_token i.e reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\nAs everyone replying my bug reports know that there is no BRUTE FORCE protection. I am doing the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of concept :\r\n================\r\n1. Generate a 'Reset Password link' of user whose account is to be compromised/hacked.\r\n2. Use a burp suite and configure it to do a Brute Force Attack on token\r\neg. https://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\nNow, it is very easy to identify valid reset_password_tokens.\r\n\r\nServer Status 200 ---\u003e valid\r\nServer Status 302 ----\u003e invalid\r\n\r\nlength 4378 ---\u003evalid\r\nlength 1525 ---\u003einvalid\r\n\r\n3. Try resetting password now.\r\n4. Login with email and password.\r\n\r\nSpecial Note :\r\n===========\r\nAttacker doing a brute force will get all valid tokens which are requested by user and are valid.\r\nSo attacker can reset password of users.\r\n\r\nThis was all from me. Hope now you understand the severity and power of Brute Force.\r\nI am attaching a screenshot POC to show that there is no protection from server side as mentioned by @michiel and @jobert to me recently about brute force.\r\n\r\nJust I made attack on my account. To show it I am attaching a screen shot. \r\nAnd there is really no protection from hackerone server. I have already made few thousands request and I am eagerly waiting for something to block me from server side.\r\n\r\nHope you quickly get back to me. :)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPranav","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eHello,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI found another bug on hackerone.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis time it is very dangerous and creative.\u003cbr\u003e\nHope you will definitely love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny valid account on hackerone can be hacked. eg Co-founders \u003ca href=\"/jobert\"\u003e@jobert\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/michiel\"\u003e@michiel\u003c/a\u003e can also be hacked.\u003cbr\u003e\nI tried this one on my account only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLets go to the point ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"things-required-to-takeover-complete-account\"\u003eThings required to takeover complete account :\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eValid email-id which is registered on hackerone.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, chaining from my previously i.e lately reported bugs.\u003cbr\u003e\nUser enumeration attack I reported recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne can find a registered email easily. eg \u003ca title=\"michiel@hackerone.com\" href=\"mailto:michiel@hackerone.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003emichiel@hackerone.com\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca title=\"jobert@hackerone.com\" href=\"mailto:jobert@hackerone.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003ejobert@hackerone.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"basic-idea\"\u003eBasic Idea :\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am requesting a \u0026#39;Reset Password link\u0026#39; to user\u0026#39;s email. \u003cbr\u003e\neg.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca title=\"https://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\"\u003ehttps://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuessing the reset_password_token i.e reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs everyone replying my bug reports know that there is no BRUTE FORCE protection.

Yes, we should be as secure as possible, but the impact of a security vulnerability can vary based upon a combination of:\n\n- The type of user that's being targeted\n- The impact of the vulnerability\n\nThis can make it that we as HackerOne, decide not to fix certain reports that other companies might have fixed.\n \n\u003e As I can find a valid email-id which is registered on hackerone and request as many links I want.\n\u003e Here, user's email inbox will be spammed. \n\u003e You would not like to lose a User or A Team which is registered on hackerone due to spamming.\n\nI personally don't think that we will lose users, in case this ever happens. Our users know that we're a security oriented site, and although we really don't like to bother our users with stuff like this, I think that they will have enough understanding of the situation to not leave our site. Even more so because we would ban the spammer as soon as we'd detect an attack.\n\n\u003e I know you will now understand the severity of this bug.

Your original report was called \"Account takeover\", but it turned into \"Ability to spam members of HackerOne\", which is a totally different report in my opinion.
