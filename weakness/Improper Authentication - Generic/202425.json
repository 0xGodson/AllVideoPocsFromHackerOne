Login to your Grab Android app using Google with valid phone number (2FA on the phone login option is correctly implemented, and not vulnerable).\n2. Edit your profile name and press Save.\n3. The 4-digit sms code will be send to your phone. Dont look to it now:)\n4.  Use my POC tool (written on C#, requires .NET 4.0). You need a one header from the any app web request (`x-mts-ssid`) for proper testing. You can extract it from the any request from Android app, using some Web Proxy.\nIf you have troubles with extracting x-mts-ssid session header from the web request - let me know. It can be tricky thing (i used android emulator, connected to Charles Web Proxy, for request monitoring).\nOpen the program, paste the x-mts-ssid in the text field and press \"Start\". Wait till process will ends (correct code will be found).\n5. Compare code from the tool, and code that you received on the phone earlier - they must be equal. Also i wrote a POC video (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8dmpoHKDZsZSFI5WXY2RzRYT00/view?usp=sharing).\n\n## Mitigation/Remediation Steps:\nI suggest you implement a rate-limiting on this endpoint, or force 2FA code expiring after, for example, 5 wrong attempts (or both of this for better security).\n\n\n","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI found the endpoint using android app \u003ccode\u003ehttps://p.grabtaxi.com/api/passenger/v2/profiles/edit\u003c/code\u003e which allow me to bypass 2FA (sms code) due to lack of rate limiting\\code expiration after unsuccessful attempts.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe root cause of the problem it that facts: no rate limiting+ no code expiration.
